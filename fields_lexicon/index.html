In tropical regions less interrupted erosion conditions have encouraged survival of older caves; the Mulu caves of Sarawak include large passages at least two million years old.  Relict caves hundreds of millions of years old may survive in some buried limestones, but are commonly filled with younger sediments (see neptunian deposits), minerals or, very rarely, igneous rocks.

Opening from the shafts are flooded cave passages at various depths, some of which have been explored subhorizontally for more than 1 km.  Their origins are complex.  Extensive stalagmite deposits show that large old caves were drained when sea-levels were low during the Pleistocene (when water was held in the ice sheets).  They are now being modified by marine dissolution, notably at the interface between fresh and salt waters (sea littoral zone) and by powerful tidal flows between connected holes[9].  2. (Jamaican.)

<td>canyon passage.</td>
<td>1. A tubular passage (cave) that is formed by underground streams following gently tilted bedding-plane partings or fractures and are eroding channels downward through the rock.  Their ceiling heights are greater than their widths.  They are similar to surface canyons, but they possess roofs and are generally the same distance apart at the top as they are at the bottom. In Mammoth Cave, most are narrow and winding and may achieve dimensions of 50 feet wide by 100 feet high.  If a canyon passage begins forming on an old tube passage, then a keyhole passage may result[15].  2. Also known as vadose canyons, these are cave passages, most commonly formed by continued floor entrenchment or incision, by a free flowing vadose stream. The passage width at any particular level is determined by the flow of the formative stream, the rate of its downcutting and the effects of any subsequent collapse.  Canyon height reflects the stream’s downcutting history.  It depends upon the vertical distance available for erosional descent to the local base level and the time that erosional downcutting has been active, as well as upon the more obvious but less important influences of flow rate and erosional capacity.  Vadose canyons commonly twist and meander sharply, while maintaining roughly parallel vertical sides. In contrast to some meanders in surface streams, underground meanders must generally be imprinted on a bedding plane before entrenchment of the canyon begins.  Narrow canyon passages, commonly less than 1 m wide and more than 20 m high, are a particular feature of deep alpine caves.  Perhaps the largest canyon passage in the world is that in Škocjanske Jama, Slovenia, which is over 100 m high and 50 m wide[9].  See paragenetic cave.

<td>cave.</td>
<td>1. ‘A natural home in the ground, large enough for human entry’ is probably the most useful definition.  This covers the enormous variety of caves that do occur but eliminates the many artificial tunnels and galleries incorrectly named caves.  The size criterion is arbitrary and subjective, but practical, as it eliminates narrow openings irrelevant to explorers but very significant hydrologically, that may be better referred to as proto-caves, sub-conduits or fissures. A cave may be a single,  short length of accessible passage, or an extensive and complex network of tunnels as long as the hundreds of kilometers in the Flint Mammoth Cave System. Most caves are formed by dissolution in limestone but sandstone caves, lava caves, glacier caves and tectonic caves also occur.  Marginal candidates for use of the name cave include riverbank undercuts and rock shelters of various origins.  In some countries a cave is regarded as being a horizontal opening, as opposed to a pothole, which is a vertical opening.  This usage is common in England but is not ubiquitous[9].  2. A natural opening formed in the rocks below the surface of the ground large enough for a man to enter.  It may consist of a single connected opening or a series of small or large chambers connected by galleries[20].  3. A similar artificial opening[10]. Related to cavern.

<td>cave development.</td>
<td>The inception of cave development in carbonate rocks begins if water can move through the bedrock and commence dissolution.  The earliest water movement may be due to mechanisms (including ground-water pumping and ionic diffusion effects) unrelated to those dominating later development.  Similarly, inception may include physical and chemical dissolution (involving removal of carbonates and mineral impurities by water and by strong acids), as well as by the carbonic acid dissolution that dominates later cave growth. Initial water movement can be along primary pores in the rock (in coarse raffle limestones, oolites or chalk), along relatively thin non-carbonate beds within the succession, or along incipient or open fissures (joints, faults and bedding planes).  These potential water routes are initially very narrow and water movement is severely restricted and laminar, allowing only very slow dissolutional growth (see gestation), until enlargement beyond the turbulent threshold (breakthrough) permits faster flow and accelerated cave growth.  After establishment of turbulent flow conditions the effects of dissolution are augmented by mechanical abrasion and collapse, which expose new rock.  During the early development stages a network of narrow openings is formed. Subsequently, geological factors guide the preferential expansion of favorable routes, which capture more of the local flow and enlarge, at the expense of less favorable openings, to form caves.  The less favorable fissures are relegated to a subordinate role in transmitting percolation water or, more rarely, in carrying elements of overflow water during floods.  Also during the early stages, all voids are water filled but as permeability increases and true hydraulic flow conditions are established, the upper voids drain freely, forming a water table.  Almost all caves therefore originate under phreatic conditions but the overall passage morphology is modified during later growth into vadose or phreatic caves, enlarged from the original phreatic imprint, above or below the water table.  Ultimately, cave development evolves towards efficient drainage close to the water table.  Passage enlargement then becomes regressive as collapse increases. The stage of a cavernous karst collapsing extensively is relatively rarely achieved, being overtaken at high latitudes and high altitudes by surface lowering, but such collapse can contribute to the chaotic land forms of tropical karst[9].</td>

<td>Determination of the age of development of caves is normally impossible.  Only the sediments they contain can be dated, and these must necessarily be younger than the containing passage.  Geomorphological correlations may allow more accurate dating of the cave erosion.  The most useful dating method in current use is based upon a knowledge of the rates of decay of radioactive isotopes of uranium to thorium in stalagmites. This technique allows measurement of ages in material up to 350,000 years old.  Dating of stalagmites has confirmed that many cave ages lie beyond this range.  Electron spin resonance (ESR) measures the cumulative effects of radiation that are partly a function of time and can give stalagmite ages back to about 900,000 years.  Palaeomagnetism may recognize events up to 2 million years old, but a sequence of palaeomagnetically dated sediments is required to allow identification of the actual ages[9].</td>

<td>dissolution of limestone.</td>
<td>The solubility of calcite (and hence of limestone) in pure water is very low, but is vastly increased in the presence of carbon dioxide.  This gas, dissolved in the water to produce carbonic acid, permits dissociation of calcium carbonate, and dissolution rates and loads are therefore directly related to carbon dioxide content.  This accounts for the importance to limestone dissolution of plant growth; soil water contains greatly more carbon dioxide than stream waters.  Further dissolution occurs due to mixing of saturated waters of different carbon dioxide content (see Mischungskorrosion), because of a non-linear relationship between carbonate saturation and carbon dioxide content.  This process is of major significance to continued dissolution within the phreas.  Cold water can dissolve more carbon dioxide but, with respect to cave development, this climatic factor is overwhelmed by the higher organic activity producing more carbon dioxide in warmer environments.  Loss of carbon dioxide, by diffusion into open air, causes water to precipitate calcite as speleothems.  Limestone dissolution may also be achieved by organic acids or by strong acids, particularly sulphuric acid, though such effects are normally far less than that of carbon dioxide.  Strong acid dissolution is probably involved in the inception of most underground drainage.  Dissolution by sulphuric acid formed by oxidation of sulfide minerals or gases may be a major cave-forming process in some regions, and was largely responsible for the enlargement of Carlsbad Caverns and Lechuguilla Cave, New Mexico[9].</td>

<td>A basin- or funnel-shaped hollow in limestone, ranging in diameter from a few meters up to a kilometer and in depth from a few to several hundred meters.  Some dolines are gentle grassy hollows; others are rocky cliff-bounded basins.  A distinction may be made by direct solution of the limestone surface zone, (solution dolines), and those formed by collapse over a cave, (collapse dolines), but it is generally not possible to establish the origin of individual examples[10].  Solutional enlargement is either circular in plan, if there is one dominant vertical joint, or otherwise irregular if there are several and can achieve dimensions of up to 1,000 meters in diameter and 100 meters deep.  Where a karst bedrock is covered by superficial deposits, solutional enlargement permits the latter to subside into vertical fissures, creating subsidence cones or alluvial dolines, whose slopes are unstable because of the unconsolidated nature of the surface material.  The bedrock remains covered in the first instance.  Dolines are also formed by the large-scale subsidence caused by cave roof-collapse of near-surface caverns; in this instance, the collapse doline, the sides are cliff-like and the floor composed of the irregular blocks from the fragmented roof.  Cave roof-collapse is considered a relatively rare phenomenon.  Closed depressions receiving a stream are known as swallow holes or stream sinks.  A doline which is largely dependent upon snow for solution-enlargement is known as a kotlici or Schneedoline[19]. In America most dolines are referred to as sinks or sinkholes.

Fengcong (pronounced ‘fungston’), which translates as ‘peak cluster’, is a mature karst normally developed during long uninterrupted periods of rapid dissolution in wet tropical environments with high levels of biogenic soil carbon dioxide.  The Chinese classify karst by the hill or peak density, in contrast to the Western classification by hill shape.  Fencong is almost the equivalent of cone karst; its closely packed hills are conical rather than hemispherical, with intervening dolines and disjointed valleys.  The major occurrences are in Guizhou and Guangxi, in southern China.  Some cones in Guangxi are so steep that they have been termed fengcong tower karst, but this concept is best avoided[9].  2.

<td>(Chinese.) 1. A karst, conspicuous in China, that is identified by its isolated limestone hills.  Fenglin (pronounced ‘funglin’) translates from Chinese as ‘peak forest’, and is distinguished from fengcong.  Both fenglin and fengcong are mature karst normally only developed by long uninterrupted periods of rapid dissolution in wet tropical environments with high levels of biogenic soil carbon dioxide.  The Chinese classify karst by the hill or peak density, in contrast to the Western classification by hill shape.  Fenglin is therefore almost the equivalent of tower karst; its hills have very steep or vertical walls, and may have a height/width ratio greater than four.  The limestone hills rise above level, alluviated plains, and the finest fenglin karst around Yangshuo, Guangxi, in southern China, is one of the world’s most dramatic landscapes.  The classification by hill density means that low residual cones scattered across a plain are also referred to as fenglin by the Chinese[9].  2. Tower karst characterized as peak forest because the individual towers appear as isolated groups on a plain.  Dry valley networks separate individual towers[4].

<td>1. White or colorless mineral or rock composed of the hydrated calcium sulfate, CaSO4.2H2O.  Gypsum rock is an evaporite precipitated from sea water and is therefore soluble in water and may contain dissolutional caves.  Mineral gypsum is formed in some caves by reactions between the host limestone and sulfates (including sulphuric acid) derived from oxidized sulfide minerals (see pyrite). Gypsum, also referred to as selenite, commonly occurs as transparent crystals, blades, needles or fibres in cave clay deposits.  A more spectacular form is as fibrous or curved crystals that may develop into cave flowers on cave walls and ceilings, as for example in parts of the Flint Mammoth Cave System, USA, or grow into large, hanging chandeliers, as in Lechuguilla Cave, New Mexico[9]. 2.

<td>Both vadose and phreatic caves can form in gypsum, which is very soluble in water, but they are uncommon because gypsum rock rarely survives total dissolution in the near-surface environments associated with explorable caves.  Gypsum caves certainly exist at depth within buried evaporate sequences.  In areas of wet climate gypsum caves are generally seen only if encountered by man-made excavations.  In contrast, gypsum caves are more common and more extensive in areas that have experienced a long period of dominantly arid climate.  The most spectacular gypsum caves are in the Podolie region of the Ukraine, where joint guided maze-cave systems are very extensive — Optimisticeskaja has around 180km of passsage[9].</td>

<td>The mineral form of sodium chloride (NaC1), or rock salt.  Halite occurs, sometimes to considerable thicknesses, in many buried-rock successions, from which it has been extracted both by mining and by redissolving it in water pumped from and back to the surface.  The existence of brine springs indicates that natural water movement occurs through buried halite sequences, presumably through voids that could be thought of as caves.  Although distinctive halite (or salt) karst features are known in some arid areas, a range of features analogous to those found on karstic rocks such as limestone are unlikely to form, and less likely to be preserved, due to halite’s relative weakness and very high solubility.  In Britain expressions of salt karstification are limited to relatively subdued surface features.  The “flashes” of the Cheshire area, are hollows, sometimes transformed into water-filled meres, formed by subsidence of overlying rocks and superficial deposits where salt has been dissolved from buried halite beds of Triassic age[9].</td>

<td>1. Any cave in rock that is partly filled with ice.  The term should not be applied to glacier caves.  The ice may form in massive icicles and flows, when percolation water from unfrozen rock seeps into a cave containing freezing air drawn in from outside.  This is a seasonal situation in many alpine caves, and if winter freezing exceeds summer melting the ice may become permanent, as in Austria’s Dachstein and Eisriesenwelt caves.  Alternately water vapor may crystallize out as hoar frost, commonly forming large hexagonal ice crystals that line the walls of a freezing cave, as in Grotte Valerie, northern Canada[9].  2. A cave, generally in lava or limestone, in which the average temperature is below 0°C., and which ordinarily contains perennial ice.  Ice may have the form of stalactites, stalagmites, or flowstone[10].

<td>keyhole passage; keyhole.</td>
<td>1. This very descriptive name derives from the cross-sectional shape of a cave passage that consists of a phreatic tube with a vadose canyon cut in its floor.  It is the classic example of a two-phase cave passage that originated and began its development in the phreas and was then modified by vadose entrenchment.  As this sequence is the result of water table lowering by normal surface erosion, keyholes are common.  Some keyholes are so small that the lower slot is impassable and the caver has to squeeze along the upper tube; others are very large.  Spectacularly long is the 5km of keyhole forming the Fissures in Castleguard Cave, Canada.  A tube 6m in diameter tops an irregular tapering canyon 15m deep that must be traversed on sloping ledges at mid-level[9].  2. A small passage or opening in a cave; in cross section, rounded at the top, constricted in the middle, and rectangular or flared out below[10]. They appear as keyholes when viewed in cross section.  They are formed when underground streams flowing in a tubular passage begin downcutting to form a canyon passage[15].  See also canyon passage; passage; tubular passage; vertical shaft.</td>

<td>1. A cave that formed in a partly cooled, broadly basaltic or phonolitic lava, not by erosion but by molten material flowing away.

Insulated inside its conduit the lava can continue to flow and develop an airspace above it, which is preserved as an explorable cave when completely cooled.  Most lava caves are just very long tubes, though branching and multiple levels may occur as dictated by flow patterns and re-invasions of older tubes.  On Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii, the Kazumura Cave is 47km long and descends 888m, but its tubes, mostly 5m in diameter, lie less than 20m beneath the sloping surface of the lava[9].  2.

The Leck Fell Master Cave, in the Yorkshire Dales, is 2km long, partly a vadose canyon, partly a drained phreatic tube and partly a submerged tube.  Part of it therefore lies below the water table while elsewhere its presence controls the water table.  The French equivalent, ‘collecteur’, is more descriptive of the master cave’s true role.  The depth to a currently active master cave is dictated by interactions between local topography, stratigraphical factors and geological structure.  In the low hill karst of England and Kentucky, active master caves lie at depths of around 100m, but in Monte Canin, Italy, and the Hautla Plateau, Mexico, they lie at depths of 1000m.  The collecteur of the Gouffre Berger, France, is met just 250m down but can be followed to a depth of over 1000m, down the dipping limestone beds, thus emphasizing the local dominance of stratigraphical over topographical factors[9].</td>

A mechanism of potentially great importance, particularly in the context of the inception of network maze caves, is multiple, diffuse input from adjacent, permeable but non-cavernous rocks.  Spectacular joint-guided maze caves such as Knock Fell Caverns and the Devis Hole Mine Caverns occur in the thin Yoredale limestones of the northern Pennines, but the most extensive mazes are in the Black Hills of Dakota, USA (including Jewel Cave) and in the Ukrainian gypsum karst (including Optimisticeskaja)[9].

Overdeveloped and self-exaggerated bend is a stream course either on the surface or underground, caused by more erosion on the outside than on the inside of a bend due to natural wash of the flow.  Undergound meanders commonly originate within bedding plane guided elements of the phreas, where a single dominant tube has gathered drainage from the surrounding area.  Following uplift and the onset of vadose conditions any stream that utilizes the meandering tube incises rapidly and the imposed meander course is entrenched into the underlying rocks. Such incision or entrenchment produces characteristic tall, narrow, twisting vadose canyons, to such an extent that the French describe them as ‘meandres’.  Canyons may meander more at their lower levels, due to enlargement during incision[9].  2. A loop-like bend in a river due to lateral erosion activities[16].  3.

<td>1. Cave conceived and developed by dissolution, usually below the water table, where all voids are water filled within the phreas.  Phreatic caves may include loops deep below the water table, particularly in dipping limestone with widely spaced bedding-related fissures. Higher fissure densities, sub-horizontal geological guidance, or greater karstic maturity encourage shallow phreatic development just below the water table.  Progressive abondonment of phreatic caves is usually in a downward sequence, as erosionally lowered valley floors intersect lower levels of the flooded system.  Active phreatic cave segments, left perched for geological reasons after a general water-table lowering, are relatively common.  Characteristics of phreatic caves are blind dissolution pockets on walls and ceilings, branching and looping of passages, and overall switchback gradients as phreatic flow may be uphill under pressure.  The most common passage, and overall switchback gradients as phreatic flow may be uphill under pressure.  The most common passage form is a tube, though cross-sectional shape reflects local geological factors.  A classic active phreatic cave is that behind the Fontaine de Vaucluse in France, while Hölloch, Switzerland, is a major system consisting mostly of relict phreatic passages[9].  2.

<td>(Slavic word for field.)  1. A large, flat floored depression in karst limestone, whose long axis is developed parallel to major structural trends and can reach tens of kilometers in length. Superficial deposits tend to accumulate on the floor.  Drainage may be by either surface watercourses (when the polje is said to be open) or swallow holes (a ‘closed’ polje.) Their development is encouraged by any impedance in the karst drainage[19].  2. Polje or karst polje signifies the flat-bottomed lands of closed basins which may extend over large areas, as much as 1,000 km2.  The flat floor of the polje may consist of bare limestone, of a nonsoluble formation (and so with rolling topography), or of soil.  The polje will show complex hydrogeological characteristics such as exsurgences, swallow holes, estavelles, and lost rivers.  In colloquial use, the term polje is applied to flat-bottomed lands which are overgrown or are under cultivation[20]. 3. Large flat-floored closed karst depression, with sharp slope breaks between the commonly alluviated floor and the marginal limestone.  Streams or springs drain into poljes and outflow is underground through ponors.  Commonly the ponors cannot transmit flood flows, so many poljes turn into wet-season lakes.  The form of some poljes is related to the geological structure, but others are purely the projects of lateral dissolution and planation.  The Dinaric Karst has many poljes; the Livansko polje is around 60km long and 7km wide.  The word is Slovene (common also to other Slav languages) for a field, reflecting the agricultural value of the alluvial polje floor soils[9]. Synonym: interior valley; (French.) polje; (German.)

<td>Most natural sandstone caves are surface river-cut notches at the foot of rock cliffs, or left part way up the cliff due to later downcutting.  This origin accounts for most of the caves once inhabited by the Pueblo Indians in the sandstone cliffs of the western USA. True caves do occur in sandstone and some of these appear to be at least partially of dissolutional origin.  Their existence probably reflects matrix leaching by ground water moving through zones of especially high primary porosity and permeability.  Though sandstones with a calcite matrix cement are more prone to such development, even siliceous cement, which has a very low solubility in water, may be removed during a sufficiently long time span.  The sandstone caves of the Sarisarinama Plateau, Venezuela may be a special case of this type of development.  These include shafts 300m in diameter and 200m deep, and passages up to 500m long.  They were probably cut in the quartz sandstone by underground streams, after early leaching of the cement by hydrothermal solutions, and the shafts have been modified by later collapse[9].</td>

The scallops are generally asymmetrical, with their upstream end steeper than the downstream end — a useful indicator of paleo-flow direction in abandoned passages[9].  2. Oval hollow having an asymmetric cross section along its main axis.

<td>1. A cave cut in any rock type where a geological weakness is exploited by the highly selective erosion power of wave action.  Fingal’s Cave, cut in the basalt of Staffa, Scotland, is a famous example.  True sea caves should not be confused with dissolutional caves that pre-dated the wave action but were then intersected and revealed as a cliff line was eroded back such as caves in the Chalk at Beachy Head in south-east England.  In some young tropical islands, dissolutional voids have formed below sea-level in the mixing zone between fresh and saline ground water.  Some have subsequently been tectonically uplifted into a shoreline position, to give the misleading impression of having developed due to waver action.  Caves of this type on the coast of Tongatapu, Tonga, have pools that connect with active dissolutional cavities below sea-level that might be related to the mixing zone[9].  2.

They are, however, the origin of such intermittent springs as the Fontestorbes spring in France, and the Ebbing and Flowing Well at Giggleswick Yorkshire.  Both flow in regular pulses when the siphon is full and working, only to cease when the siphon input is broken by air, as the upstream reservoir level drops.  Their operation depends on critical flows and both operate only in favorable weather conditions[9].  2.

<td>stalactite.</td>
<td>1. Speleothem, generally of calcite, formed by dripping water and hanging from a cave roof.  Stalactites embrace an enormous variety of sizes and shapes.  They form where percolation water seeps from a cave ceiling and becomes saturated with respect to calcite due to loss of carbon dioxide into the cave air.  Calcite is precipitated round the rim of the water droplet and continued deposition creates a hollow tubular straw stalactite (soda straw).  Additional deposition of calcite on the outside of the initial cylinder creates an ordinary tapering stalactite. Almost infinite variation in shape may be influenced by changes in water flow, cave air chemistry, evaporation, temperature or dissolved impurities, and by crystal growth blocking flow paths.   They are the most common speleothem.  Though the single 7m long stalactite in Ireland’s Poll an Ionain is not the world’s longest, it is uniquely spectacular against the dark chamber walls[9].  2. Conical deposit of calcite or aragonite often with a hollow center hanging from the roof of a cave or cavern formed by precipitation of carbonate due to escape of CO2 from hanging water beads and to evaporation of part of the water[20].  3. A cylindrical or conical deposit of minerals, generally calcite, formed by dripping water, hanging from the roof of a cave, generally having a hollow tube at its center.

<td>stalagmite.</td>
<td>1. Speleothem, normally of calcite, formed by upward growth from a cave floor, and therefore the complement of a stalactite.  Stalagmites form when dripwater that is still saturated falls from a cave roof or stalactite and, when or after it lands, loses more carbon dioxide to the cave air, causing precipitation of calcite.  They vary in size and shape, from tall thin towers to wide domes that grade into flowstone, the main controls being drip rate and height, and saturation levels of the water.  The stalagmites of Aven Armand, France, are of the multiple splash-cup variety while being notably slender and up to 30m tall.  Spectacularly massive stalagmites occur in the Carlsbad and Cottonwood Caves of New Mexico[9].  2. Columnar or partly irregular deposit of calcite or aragonite on the floor of a cave or cavern formed by the precipitation of carbonates due to escape of CO2 from water dripping from the roof[20].  3. A deposit of calcium carbonate rising from the floor of a limestone cave, formed by precipitation from a bicarbonate solution through loss of CO2. The water drops on the stalagmite from above.

Similarly, water added to storage with a rise in head is accommodated partly by compression of the water and partly by expansion of the aquifer.  In an unconfined aquifer, the amount of water so released or accepted is generally negligible compared to the amount involved in gravity drainage or filling of pores, hence, in an unconfined aquifer, the storage coefficient is virtually equal to the specific yield.  2. The volume of water an aquifer releases from or takes into storage per unit surface area of the aquifer per unit change in head (virtually equal to the specific yield in an unconfined aquifer.) 3. The volume of water a confined hydrogeologic unit releases from or takes into storage per unit subsurface area of the hydrogeologic unit per unit change in head.</td>

In one-dimensional compression, effective stress is the average grain-to-grain load per unit area in a plane normal to the applied stress.  At any given depth, the effective stress is the weight (per unit area) of sediments and moisture above the water table, plus the submerged weight (per unit area) of sediments between the water table and the specified depth, plus or minus the seepage stress (hydrodynamic drag) produced by downward or upward components, respectively, of water movement through the saturated sediments above the specified depth.

Sulfates are deposited as a generally minor component of most carbonate successions, but due to their high solubility they may not survive subsequent dissolution by ground water.  Even if they survive subsequent dissolution by ground water.  Even if they survive at depth, they tend to dissolve as they are raised nearer to the surface following uplift and erosion of overburden.  Removal of sulfates by dissolution may contribute to the early establishment of secondary permeability in limestone sequences.

<td>1. A spectacular variety of karst landscape dominated by steep or vertical sided limestone towers each 30–300m high.  By far the most extensive and best developed tower karst is the Guangxi province of southern China.  Towers originate as residual cones and are then steepened by water table undercutting from surround alluviated plains. Tectonic uplift matched by karst erosion then increases tower heights, but if uplift exceeds surface lowering the towers are raised to hillside locations and the landscape is rejuvenated to form a new generation of dolines and cone karst.  Many towers are riddled with relict caves at high levels, and with active caves through their bases[9].  2. Karst topography characterized by isolated residual limestone hills displaying numerous shapes (e.g., cone shaped, steep-sided) separated by areas of alluvium or other detrital sand; towers are generally forest-covered hills, and many have flat tops.

<td>Trittkarren.</td>
<td>(German.) These are best described as heel-print karren because they resemble the imprint of a heel.  They are nearly connected with subhorizontal, adjacent, flat plains and migrate upslope by cutting ‘steps’ through the process of retrogressive corrosion.  The semi-circular form is preserved by the ‘horseshoe falls effect’ which concentrates the main amount of water on the innermost part of the heel-print.  At the upper rim the water gain speed.  The thickness of the film of water is indirectly proportional to the speed of the flow.  A higher rate of flow results in a greater effectiveness of fresh precipitation added to the flow on the ground, but it also causes the diffusion of atmospheric CO2 and more extensive corrosion.  Most Trittkarren originate at the rim of a grike lying below and have moved upward to the surface through retrogressive corrosion.  At the base of steep slopes where snow collects, nearly funnel-shaped Trittkarren appear and are of subnival origin.  They are common in the Alps[3].  Synonym: heel-print karren.</td>

Relict tubes, abandoned as the water table was lowered, are common in old caves, and may be partially filled by sediment, breakdown or stalagmite, or entrenched to form keyhole passages.  Tube sizes range to over 15m in diameter, but the larger ones are rarely of uniform section.  Peak Cavern in Derbyshire is well known for its fine circular phreatic tubes.  Some of the trunk passages of Mammoth Cave, Kentucky, are spectacular tubes of elliptical section, formed by dissolution rates that were higher along the bedding than across[9].  2. These are nearly horizontal cave passages (tunnels) with round or elliptical cross sections and are either straight or winding.  At Mammoth Cave they vary in size up to 30 feet high and nearly 100 feet wide.  They are formed while completely filled with flowing water.  Whereas they are typically wider than high as a result of dissolution along horizontal cracks and bedding-plane partings, they may also form as high, narrow, straight fissures along major vertical or near vertical fractures[15].

<td>vadose cave.</td>
<td>1. A cave that underwent most of its development above the water table.  Within the vadose zone, drainage is free-flowing under gravity, and cave passages therefore have air above any water surface.  The gravitational control of vadose flow means that all vadose cave passages drain downslope, they exist in the upper part of a karst aquifer, and they ultimately drain into the phreatic zone or out to the surface.  Active stream caves, explorable by non-diving cavers, are by definition vadose (though they generally have phreatic origins).  Characteristics of vadose caves are uneroded ceilings (except for immature phreatic features pre-dating the vadose conditions) and continuous downhill gradients (unless interrupted by short perched sumps).  The main passage forms are canyons, with meanders and potholes, broken by sub-cylindrical, spray- corroded shafts that may demonstrate waterfall retreat.  Some of the caves of Monte Canin, Italy, are spectacularly long and deep vadose systems[9].  2. Older, higher cave passages found in the vadose zone; usually vadose caves have been abandoned by the ground water except in times of extreme aquifer recharge.  Passages are usually appear as canyons and keyholes.</td>

<td>water table.</td>
<td>1. The top surface of a body of slowly moving ground water that fills the pore spaces within a rock mass.  Above it lies the freely draining vadose zone, and below it lies the permanently saturated phreas.  In uniform aquifers, such as sandstone, the water table is a smoothly contoured surface intersecting the ground at rivers and lakes, but in limestone it is more complex.  Individual cave conduits may be above or below the water table, and therefore either vadose or phreatic, and the water table cannot normally be related to them.  The water table concept does, however, apply to the diffuse drainage of percolation water in the micro- fissure network of limestone, but its detailed structure may be complicated by the presence of conduits.  The water-table slope (hydraulic gradient) is low in limestone due to the high permeability, and the level is controlled by outlet springs or local geological features.  High flows create steeper hydraulic gradients and hence rises in the water level away from the spring. In France’s Grotte de la Luire, the water level in the cave (and therefore the local water table) fluctuates by 450m[9].  2. The upper surface of a zone of saturation except where that surface is formed by a confining unit[22].  3. The upper surface of the zone of saturation on which the water pressure in the porous medium equals atmospheric pressure[22].  4. The upper boundary of an unconfined zone of saturation, along which the hydrostatic pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure[10].  See also potentiometric surface.</td>

<td>In theory the water table offers the prime environment for cave development as it provides the shortest route through the phreas and is potentially more active chemically due to the presence of the air/water interface.  However, geological factors determine the details of cave inception and enlargement, and passages most commonly form just below the water table as a shallow phreatic variety of cave development.  Development of this type is believed to be responsible for the ‘levels’ of cave passage found in some areas, as in the flint Mammoth Cave System, Kentucky.  True water-table caves are rare except on a limited scale as extensions to cliff foot notches margined to tropical swamps.  Also under these conditions, the water table may adjust down to the level of a mature phreatic cave and then modify the passage with horizontal dissolution notches — as is common in the caves of Mulu and Niah, Sarawak[9].</td>

<td>Underground drainage links through unexplored caves confirmed by labeling input water and identifying it at points downstream.  The common labeling techniques involve the use of fluorescent dyes (fluorescein, rhodamine, leucophor, pyranine etc.), lycopodium spores, or chemicals such as common salt.  Detection of dye downstream may be purely visual, but if the dye is used at a subvisible (environmentally acceptable) dilution, suitable detectors must be placed in all potential risings and collected for subsequent fluorometric examination (although water samples are more desirable and beneficial).  Lycopodium spores are usually collected in fine nets, along with other stream-borne sediment, and must then be identified under the microscope.  If chemical tracers are used, regular water samples must be collected for subsequent analysis, or the resurgent waters must be monitored with suitable electronic detectors and recorders.  Flowpaths can also be confirmed by transmission of artificial or natural flood pulses, which provide additional data on the nature of conduits, as a pulse is transmitted instantaneously through flooded passages. The longest successful water trace was from Beysehir Golu to the Manavgat springs, in Turkey, over a distance of 130km; 390kg of fluorescein was used and the dye reappeared after 366 days[9].</td>
