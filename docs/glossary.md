# Cave and Karst Glossary Development

Currently the UISIC's Cave and Karst Glossary project is available at 
<https://uisic.uis-speleo.org/lexgloss.html>
This page is a **development** site to experiment with alternate ways
to present this information.

To view a glossary of Karst terms in your language please enter your language
and press submit.

*Note for developer: For languages where we have very few entries we might wish 
to display the following notice showing the number "N" of terms in that language.*

There are N glossary items for your language. Perhaps you might 
wish to look at the English or French glossaries as they are complete,
having N glossaries.
