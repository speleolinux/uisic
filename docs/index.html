<td>accelerated corrosion.</td>
<td>A localized concentration of solution intensity, produced by factors favoring greater aggressivity of the water in certain parts of the karstland creating differential solution rates and thereby a marked unevenness in the overall erosion of the karstland[19]. See also corrosion; alluvial corrosion.</td>

<td>15</td>
<td>acid.</td>
<td>Any chemical compound containing hydrogen capable of being replaced by positive elements or radicals to form salts. In terms of dissociation theory, it is a compound which, on dissociation in solution, yields excess hydrogen ions. Acids lower the pH. Examples of acids or acidic substances are hydrochloric acid, tannic acid, and sodium acid pyrophosphate[6].</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>16</td>
<td>acidity.</td>
<td>The property of water having a pH below 4.5 that is caused by the presence of mineral acids. Usually expressed in equivalent amounts of calcium carbonate[16]. See also alkalinity; pH.</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>17</td>
<td>acid mine drainage.</td>

<td>acoustic resistance.</td>
<td>The product of wave velocity and rock density indicating the reflective power of a boundary between two strata[16].</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>20</td>
<td>activated charcoal, activated carbon.</td>
<td>A granular material usually produced by the roasting of cellulose base substances, such as wood or coconut shells, in the absence of air. It has an extremely porous structure and is used in water conditioning as an adsorbent for organic matter and certain dissolved gases[6]. It is especially useful for adsorbing tracer dyes.</td>
