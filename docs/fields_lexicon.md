Abstract: This document is a glossary of most terms that have some
relationship to the field of environmental karst, as well as specific-karst
terms. It includes many foreign terms because much karst research is conducted
in foreign countries and published using local terminology. In many instances,
common environmental terms are defined in such a way as to specifically
reference karstic phenomena. The purpose of this document is to serve as a
technical guide to regional offices and the public in general who must read the
karst literature or hold discussions with karst researchers.

In most regions the youngest cave passages have reached their present dimensions during the last 10,000 years, or since the last Pleistocene glacial retreat.  In higher latitudes most caves can be related to erosion during the later Pleistocene climatic variations of the last million years, and older caves have largely been removed by continuing surface lowering.  In tropical regions less interrupted erosion conditions have encouraged survival of older caves; the Mulu caves of Sarawak include large passages at least two million years old.  Relict caves hundreds of millions of years old may survive in some buried limestones, but are commonly filled with younger sediments (see neptunian deposits), minerals or, very rarely, igneous rocks.  These fill materials may themselves be dateable, either on the basis of contained fossil material (including pollen), by comparison with similar rock types that occur at the surface or by isotopic age determination methods identical to those applied to suitable surface rock materials.

| 42 | aggressiveness. | A measure of the relative capacity of water to dissolve rock material.  In the context of karstification and speleogenesis this usually concerns the dissolution of limestone or dolomite by the action of dissolved carbon dioxide (carbonic acid), though other acids may also be involved[9].  |

Individual anastomoses most commonly have a diameter of approximately 100 mm and networks may contain hundreds of tubes.  Most anastomoses are abandoned when one channel offers preferential flow conditions so that it increases in size at the expense of others.

| 161 | aven. | 1.  A hole in the roof of a cave passage that may be either a rather large blind roof pocket or a tributary inlet shaft into the cave system.  A feature described as an aven when seen from below may equally be described as shaft when seen from above, and the naming of such a feature commonly depends purely upon the direction of exploration.  Many avens close upwards to impenetrable fissures but may still be important hydrological routes; few caves are without them. In parts of France, aven is equivalent to the British term, pothole[9].  2. (French.)

These laminations may be clearly visible where lithologies change or where depositional cycles were completed/initiated, or they may be effectively invisible to the naked eye, marking subtle changes in depositional conditions.  Most bedding planes were originally horizontal or very slightly inclined, but more steeply inclined bedding planes developed in rocks deposited in deltaic or sand dune environments or in marine reefs.  When rocks are folded the bedding planes provide an indication of the degree of deformation.  Bedding planes play a crucial role in the inception and ongoing development of most caves and many surface karst features[3]. 2. A plane that separates two strata of differing characteristics[10].  See also parting.  |
| 235 | bedding-plane cave. | 1. Bedding planes are widespread and very significant features within most carbonate rocks, and cave passages are commonly guided by them.  Their structure, their distribution and the chemical contrasts that some bedding planes provide may be the major influence during the earliest phases of development of a cave system.  The term bedding-plane cave is strictly applied to a passage that has not enlarged by growth into a major tube or canyon, but has remained almost entirely on the bedding plane.  A famous example is Hensler’s Passage, in Gaping Gill, Yorkshire, which is over 400 m long, nearly over 5 m wide and nowhere higher than 1 m[9].  2. A passage formed along a bedding plane, especially when there is a difference in susceptibility to corrosion in the two beds[10].  3.

| 259 | blind valley. | 1. A karst valley abruptly terminated by the passage underground of the watercourse which has hitherto resisted the karst processes and remained at the surface.  An intermediate type, the half-blind valley, exists in which the valley form continues downstream from the sinkhole used under conditions of normal river flow.  The watercourse only flows here intermittently and the valley may (except for its use as a flood conduit) be fossil in that it represents the section abandoned by the river as it sought progressively higher swallow holes[19]. 2. A karst valley with no evident downstream continuation, and one in which the water drains and disappears underground into one or more ponors[20].  3. A valley that terminates abruptly at a point where its stream sinks, or once sank, underground.

Opening from the shafts are flooded cave passages at various depths, some of which have been explored subhorizontally for more than 1 km.  Their origins are complex.  Extensive stalagmite deposits show that large old caves were drained when sea-levels were low during the Pleistocene (when water was held in the ice sheets).  They are now being modified by marine dissolution, notably at the interface between fresh and salt waters (sea littoral zone) and by powerful tidal flows between connected holes[9].  2. (Jamaican.) A major emergence where water (artesian spring) rises from below without great turbulence.  3. (Bahamas.) A drowned solution sinkhole[10].  4.

This meaning is based on the Serbian use[20].  2. A variable-discharge artesian spring in which hydrostatic pressure is great enough to cause a turbulent or even fountain-like discharge.  3. A long narrow chasm enlarged by solution of the limestone[10].  4. Large linear fissure or box valley through a karst block.

| 290 | breakthrough time. | The time required to develop a conduit large enough (usually 5–10 mm in diameter) to support turbulent flow[9].  |
| 291 | breathing cave. | Air movement through a cave is described as breathing when it reverses more frequently than the seasonal reversal of a through-draught in a cave with higher and lower entrances.  Slow breathing occurs in response to barometric pressure changes, when the volume of cave air is forced to change.  It is notoriously strong in large caves of the Australian Nullarbor Plain.  More rapid wind reversals or oscillations, as in Breathing Cave, Virginia, are a resonance phenomenon, similar to the effect produced by air passing over the neck of a bottle.  In the cave environment the resonant frequency is relatively low and periodic air flow reversals occur, rather than the sound waves observed at the higher frequencies met in the bottle neck example[9].  |
| 292 | breathing hole. | Opening in the roof of a cave, cavern or other underground void through which air is sucked in and expelled in a rhythmic manner similar to inhalation and exhalation of breath[20]. Related to blow hole and steam hole.  Synonyms: (French.) trou souffleur; (German.) Luftloch, (Greek.) anapnéousa opí spiléou; (Spanish.) respirador; (Turkish.) esintili delik.  |

Many fault planes are marked by zones of broken rock, either loose or re-cemented, forming a fault breccia[9].  2. Rock composed of angular fragments[16].  |
| 294 | bridge. | 1. May be a natural bridge of bedrock normally formed outside a cave entrance by partial collapse leaving an isolated roof segment, as in the famous examples of Rakov Škocjan, Slovenia.  Rock bridges may also occur inside caves due either surrounding phreatic dissolution or collapse between superimposed passages.  Another common type inside a cave is a span of false floor where sediment is washed from below, as at The Bridge in GB Cavern in the Mendip Hills[9].  2. In a cave, a residual rock span across a passage[10].  3. In water wells, an obstruction in the drill hole or annulus.  A bridge is usually formed by caving of the wall of the well bore, by the intrusion of a large boulder, or by filter pack materials during well completion.  Bridging can also occur in the formation during well development[16].  See also natural bridge.  |

See also bogaz; chasm; gorge; ravine.  |
| 334 | canyon passage. | 1. A tubular passage (cave) that is formed by underground streams following gently tilted bedding-plane partings or fractures and are eroding channels downward through the rock.  Their ceiling heights are greater than their widths.  They are similar to surface canyons, but they possess roofs and are generally the same distance apart at the top as they are at the bottom. In Mammoth Cave, most are narrow and winding and may achieve dimensions of 50 feet wide by 100 feet high.  If a canyon passage begins forming on an old tube passage, then a keyhole passage may result[15].  2. Also known as vadose canyons, these are cave passages, most commonly formed by continued floor entrenchment or incision, by a free flowing vadose stream. The passage width at any particular level is determined by the flow of the formative stream, the rate of its downcutting and the effects of any subsequent collapse.  Canyon height reflects the stream’s downcutting history.  It depends upon the vertical distance available for erosional descent to the local base level and the time that erosional downcutting has been active, as well as upon the more obvious but less important influences of flow rate and erosional capacity.  Vadose canyons commonly twist and meander sharply, while maintaining roughly parallel vertical sides. In contrast to some meanders in surface streams, underground meanders must generally be imprinted on a bedding plane before entrenchment of the canyon begins.  Narrow canyon passages, commonly less than 1 m wide and more than 20 m high, are a particular feature of deep alpine caves.  Perhaps the largest canyon passage in the world is that in Škocjanske Jama, Slovenia, which is over 100 m high and 50 m wide[9].  See paragenetic cave.

It consists of two chambers, a water tank above and a removable carbide canister below with a connection valve to permit controlled seepage of water into the calcium carbide.  The carbide and water react to generate calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] and acetylene gas.  The gas is passed through a filter into a tube and through a tiny burner-tip orifice designed for the optimum mixture of air and acetylene.  Once ignited, it burns with a brilliant yellow-white flame produced by the incandescence of tiny carbon particles.  A reflector concentrates the light in a particular direction[13].  |

| 375 | carbonic acid dissolution. | Dissolution of calcium carbonate by carbon dioxide in aqueous solution, loosely termed carbonic acid, is the dominant reaction in karst processes, including speleogenesis.  The reaction can be considered in several ways but it is most simply represented as: CaCO3 + CO2 + H2O ⇌ Ca(HCO3)2 The reaction is reversible.  The solution containing the dissolved reaction product, usually termed calcium bicarbonate, can lose carbon dioxide to the atmosphere and precipitate calcium carbonate. This process is responsible for the development of speleothems underground and tufa or travertine at the surface[9].  |

| 387 | cave. | 1. ‘A natural home in the ground, large enough for human entry’ is probably the most useful definition.  This covers the enormous variety of caves that do occur but eliminates the many artificial tunnels and galleries incorrectly named caves.  The size criterion is arbitrary and subjective, but practical, as it eliminates narrow openings irrelevant to explorers but very significant hydrologically, that may be better referred to as proto-caves, sub-conduits or fissures. A cave may be a single,  short length of accessible passage, or an extensive and complex network of tunnels as long as the hundreds of kilometers in the Flint Mammoth Cave System. Most caves are formed by dissolution in limestone but sandstone caves, lava caves, glacier caves and tectonic caves also occur.  Marginal candidates for use of the name cave include riverbank undercuts and rock shelters of various origins.  In some countries a cave is regarded as being a horizontal opening, as opposed to a pothole, which is a vertical opening.  This usage is common in England but is not ubiquitous[9].  2. A natural opening formed in the rocks below the surface of the ground large enough for a man to enter.  It may consist of a single connected opening or a series of small or large chambers connected by galleries[20].  3. A similar artificial opening[10]. Related to cavern.

| 396 | cave development. | The inception of cave development in carbonate rocks begins if water can move through the bedrock and commence dissolution.  The earliest water movement may be due to mechanisms (including ground-water pumping and ionic diffusion effects) unrelated to those dominating later development.  Similarly, inception may include physical and chemical dissolution (involving removal of carbonates and mineral impurities by water and by strong acids), as well as by the carbonic acid dissolution that dominates later cave growth. Initial water movement can be along primary pores in the rock (in coarse raffle limestones, oolites or chalk), along relatively thin non-carbonate beds within the succession, or along incipient or open fissures (joints, faults and bedding planes).  These potential water routes are initially very narrow and water movement is severely restricted and laminar, allowing only very slow dissolutional growth (see gestation), until enlargement beyond the turbulent threshold (breakthrough) permits faster flow and accelerated cave growth.  After establishment of turbulent flow conditions the effects of dissolution are augmented by mechanical abrasion and collapse, which expose new rock.  During the early development stages a network of narrow openings is formed. Subsequently, geological factors guide the preferential expansion of favorable routes, which capture more of the local flow and enlarge, at the expense of less favorable openings, to form caves.  The less favorable fissures are relegated to a subordinate role in transmitting percolation water or, more rarely, in carrying elements of overflow water during floods.  Also during the early stages, all voids are water filled but as permeability increases and true hydraulic flow conditions are established, the upper voids drain freely, forming a water table.  Almost all caves therefore originate under phreatic conditions but the overall passage morphology is modified during later growth into vadose or phreatic caves, enlarged from the original phreatic imprint, above or below the water table.  Ultimately, cave development evolves towards efficient drainage close to the water table.  Passage enlargement then becomes regressive as collapse increases. The stage of a cavernous karst collapsing extensively is relatively rarely achieved, being overtaken at high latitudes and high altitudes by surface lowering, but such collapse can contribute to the chaotic land forms of tropical karst[9].  |
| 397 | cave earth, cave fill. | Insoluble deposits of clay, silt, sand, or gravel flooring or filling a cave passage.  In a more restricted sense, cave earth includes only the finer fractions: clay, silt, and fine sand deposits[10].  Synonym: cave soil.  |

Pearls form in pools of saturated water disturbed by dripping water, so that they are commonly found beneath high avens.  Individual pearls may be lmm or many centimeters in diameter.  Movement of the larger ones may become impossible and they can then become cemented to the pool floor.

Black, brown or grey rock, consisting of very fine-grained silica, that occurs as horizons of nodules and discontinuous bands, generally less than 200mm thick, within many limestones.  It is very hard and almost insoluble in water, so commonly it projects from cave walls where it forms passage or shaft ledges and waterfall lips[9].  2. Light-cream or gray to black rock composed of silica, found occurring as nodules or layers in limestone, or as a replacement of limestone[10].  |
| 471 | Chézy equation. | An equation used to compute the velocity of uniform flow in an open channel: mean velocity of flow (V) equals the Chézy coefficient © times the square root of the product of hydraulic radius in feet (R) times the slope of the channel[1].  See also Froude number; Manning equation; Reynolds number.  |
| 472 | chimney. | 1.  Nearly circular shaft rising upwards from the ceiling of a cave towards the surface of the ground; if it does not reach the surface it is termed a blind chimney.  If the chimney is formed mainly by solution, it is related to a dome-pit; if formed mainly by collapse of the roof along bedding planes, it is related to cenote[20].  2.

| 521 | coefficient of compressibility. | Compressibility is the aptitude of the soil to be deformed.  It is expressed by means of a coefficient which is the ratio between a void ratio decrease from e0 to e and an increase in effective stress.

| 529 | collapse chamber. | An underground chamber containing notable quantities of collapsed material. The term is commonly abused in describing the origin of cave chambers floored by collapse debris.  Though wall and roof collapse are common modifying processes in larger chambers, it is important to remember that such collapse cannot form a chamber, as it can only take place into a pre-existing cavity[9].  |
| 530 | collapse sink; collapse sinkhole. | 1. A variety of closed depression that forms by collapse of the rock above an existing cave passage or chamber[9].  2. A closed depression formed by the collapse of the roof of a cave[10].  See also doline.  |

Massive unfractured limestone can easily span a void of over 100m, but thinly bedded, closely jointed, faulted or poorly lithified limestone may collapse into very small passages.  Collapse is a significant component of cave erosion.  As well as simple falls of unsupported rock forming connections between passages, the collapse process exposes more rock surface area for potential dissolution.  As rates of collapse are measured on a geological time scale collapse in natural caves offers a negligible threat to explorers, in comparison to the dangers of roof collapse in mines[9].  |

| 536 | community. | All the plants and animals that live in a particular habitat and are bound together by food chains and other interrelations[23].  |
| 537 | compaction. | A decrease in the volume of a mass of sediments from any cause.  In general, compaction may be regarded as the decrease in the thickness of sediments, as a result of an increase in vertical compressive stress, and is synonymous with ‘one-dimensional consolidation,’ as used by engineers.  The term compaction is applied both to the process and to the measured change in thickness.  In thick fine-grained beds, compaction is a delayed process involving the slow escape of pore water and the gradual transfer of stress from neutral to effective.  Until sufficient time has passed for excess pore pressure to decrease to zero, measured values of compaction are transient[21].  See also compaction, residual; compaction, specific.  |
| 538 | compaction, residual. | Compaction that would occur ultimately if a given increase in applied stress were maintained until steady-state pore pressures were achieved, but had not occurred as of a specified time because excess pore pressures still existed in beds of low diffusivity in the compacting system.  It can also be regarded as the difference between (1) the amount of compaction that will occur ultimately for a given increase in applied stress, and (2) that which has occurred at a specified time[21].  See also compaction; compaction, specific.  |
| 539 | compaction, specific. | The decrease in thickness of deposits, per unit of increase in applied stress, during a specific period of time[21].  See also compaction; compaction, residual.  |

| 551 | conduit; karst conduit. | Relatively large dissolutional voids, including enlarged fissures and tubular tunnels; in some usage the term is restricted to voids that are water-filled.  Conduits may include all voids greater than 10mm in diameter, but another classification scheme places them between arbitrary limits of 100mm to 10m.  Whichever value is accepted in a particular context, smaller voids are commonly termed sub-conduits[9].  Synonyms: (French.) conduite forcée; (German.) Druckleitung (Leitung); (Greek.) siphon; (Italian.) condotta forzata; (Spanish.) conducto saturado; (Turkish.) yeraltısu yolu, mecra.  See also pressure flow tube; stream tube; siphon.  |
| 552 | conduit flow; karst conduit flow. | Underground water flow within conduits.  Conduit flow is generally turbulent, but can also be laminar[9].  |

Erosion that seems to be initiated in valley systems develops in such a way that the valleys break up into dolines, but the mechanisms leading to uniform shaping of the hills are not fully understood.  The widespread cone karst in China is mostly known as fengcong, and its hills are generally more conical than hemispherical in profile[9].  2.

This technique allows measurement of ages in material up to 350,000 years old.  Dating of stalagmites has confirmed that many cave ages lie beyond this range.  Electron spin resonance (ESR) measures the cumulative effects of radiation that are partly a function of time and can give stalagmite ages back to about 900,000 years.

| 749 | dissolution. | See solution.  |
| 750 | dissolution of limestone. | The solubility of calcite (and hence of limestone) in pure water is very low, but is vastly increased in the presence of carbon dioxide.  This gas, dissolved in the water to produce carbonic acid, permits dissociation of calcium carbonate, and dissolution rates and loads are therefore directly related to carbon dioxide content.  This accounts for the importance to limestone dissolution of plant growth; soil water contains greatly more carbon dioxide than stream waters.  Further dissolution occurs due to mixing of saturated waters of different carbon dioxide content (see Mischungskorrosion), because of a non-linear relationship between carbonate saturation and carbon dioxide content.  This process is of major significance to continued dissolution within the phreas.  Cold water can dissolve more carbon dioxide but, with respect to cave development, this climatic factor is overwhelmed by the higher organic activity producing more carbon dioxide in warmer environments.  Loss of carbon dioxide, by diffusion into open air, causes water to precipitate calcite as speleothems.  Limestone dissolution may also be achieved by organic acids or by strong acids, particularly sulphuric acid, though such effects are normally far less than that of carbon dioxide.  Strong acid dissolution is probably involved in the inception of most underground drainage.  Dissolution by sulphuric acid formed by oxidation of sulfide minerals or gases may be a major cave-forming process in some regions, and was largely responsible for the enlargement of Carlsbad Caverns and Lechuguilla Cave, New Mexico[9].  |

Water in other aquifers above or below, and even in the lower part of the same aquifer, may have a potentiometric surface lacking the ridge, and so may flow past the divide.

| 760 | doline; sinkhole. | A basin- or funnel-shaped hollow in limestone, ranging in diameter from a few meters up to a kilometer and in depth from a few to several hundred meters.  Some dolines are gentle grassy hollows; others are rocky cliff-bounded basins.  A distinction may be made by direct solution of the limestone surface zone, (solution dolines), and those formed by collapse over a cave, (collapse dolines), but it is generally not possible to establish the origin of individual examples[10].  Solutional enlargement is either circular in plan, if there is one dominant vertical joint, or otherwise irregular if there are several and can achieve dimensions of up to 1,000 meters in diameter and 100 meters deep.  Where a karst bedrock is covered by superficial deposits, solutional enlargement permits the latter to subside into vertical fissures, creating subsidence cones or alluvial dolines, whose slopes are unstable because of the unconsolidated nature of the surface material.  The bedrock remains covered in the first instance.  Dolines are also formed by the large-scale subsidence caused by cave roof-collapse of near-surface caverns; in this instance, the collapse doline, the sides are cliff-like and the floor composed of the irregular blocks from the fragmented roof.  Cave roof-collapse is considered a relatively rare phenomenon.  Closed depressions receiving a stream are known as swallow holes or stream sinks.  A doline which is largely dependent upon snow for solution-enlargement is known as a kotlici or Schneedoline[19]. In America most dolines are referred to as sinks or sinkholes.

| 910 | fengcong; fengcong karst. | (Chinese.)  1. A karst, conspicuous in China, that is identified by its clustered limestone hills.  Fengcong (pronounced ‘fungston’), which translates as ‘peak cluster’, is a mature karst normally developed during long uninterrupted periods of rapid dissolution in wet tropical environments with high levels of biogenic soil carbon dioxide.  The Chinese classify karst by the hill or peak density, in contrast to the Western classification by hill shape.  Fencong is almost the equivalent of cone karst; its closely packed hills are conical rather than hemispherical, with intervening dolines and disjointed valleys.  The major occurrences are in Guizhou and Guangxi, in southern China.  Some cones in Guangxi are so steep that they have been termed fengcong tower karst, but this concept is best avoided[9].  2.

See also fenglin; fungling; mogote; tower karst.  |
| 911 | fenglin; fenglin karst. | (Chinese.) 1. A karst, conspicuous in China, that is identified by its isolated limestone hills.  Fenglin (pronounced ‘funglin’) translates from Chinese as ‘peak forest’, and is distinguished from fengcong.  Both fenglin and fengcong are mature karst normally only developed by long uninterrupted periods of rapid dissolution in wet tropical environments with high levels of biogenic soil carbon dioxide.  The Chinese classify karst by the hill or peak density, in contrast to the Western classification by hill shape.  Fenglin is therefore almost the equivalent of tower karst; its hills have very steep or vertical walls, and may have a height/width ratio greater than four.  The limestone hills rise above level, alluviated plains, and the finest fenglin karst around Yangshuo, Guangxi, in southern China, is one of the world’s most dramatic landscapes.  The classification by hill density means that low residual cones scattered across a plain are also referred to as fenglin by the Chinese[9].  2.

| 1052 | glaciokarst. | 1. A karst landscape that was glaciated during the cold periods of the Pleistocene and displays major landforms of relict glacial origin.  Bare rock scars, locally with glacial striations, and limestone pavements are characteristic, due to the lack of rapid soil formation on the limestones since glacial stripping.  Dolines within a glaciokarst are mostly small and immature, as are caves, except where pre-glacial passages are intercepted.  Glaciokarst is almost synonymous with alpine karst, and some of the finest is developed on the high plateaus of the Calcareous Alps, south of Salzburg, Austria[9].  2.

Once initiated, by calcite-saturated water overflowing from floor hollows, development is self-enhancing, and the gours can grow into large dams many meters high and wide.  Inside the gour pool, more calcite may be precipitated as crystals or pearls.  Large flights of gours occur in many caves, with spectacular and well known examples around the Hall of Thirteen in the Gouffre Berger, France.  Large travertine, gours can form in the open air, as at Band-i-Amir, Afghanistan[9].  See also rimstone barrage; rimstone barrier; rimstone dam.  |

| 1087 | ground-water basin. | 1. A general term used to define a ground-water flow system that has defined boundaries and may include permeable materials that are capable of storing or furnishing a significant water supply; the basin includes both the surface area and the permeable materials beneath it[22].  2. The area throughout which ground water drains towards the same point; it can be larger than the accompanying surface water drainage basin if permeable layers extend outside of the topographic divide[16].

Perched ground water is held up by a perching bed whose permeability is so low that water percolating downward through it is not able to bring water in the underlying unsaturated zone above atmospheric pressure[22].  See also perched ground water.  |
| 1099 | ground-water pumping. | 1. Directed or oscillatory ground-water movement, along incipient fissures in the rock, that occurs due to very small but significant relative movements of the rocks themselves, maybe as a diurnal, tidal process.  It may be one of the driving mechanisms of earliest, inception, phase of speleogenesis[9].  The pumping of a water well to provide water for drinking, irrigation, and manufacturing. but may also be conducted for dewatering purposes.  |

| 1104 | ground-water travel time. | 1. The time-required for ground water to travel between two locations[22].  2. The time required for a unit volume of ground water to travel between two locations.  The travel time is the length of the flow path divided by the velocity, where velocity is the average ground-water flux passing through the cross-sectional area of the geologic medium through which flow occurs, perpendicular to the flow direction, divided by the effective porosity along the flow path.  If discrete segments of the flow path have different hydrologic properties, the total travel time will be the sum of the travel times for each discrete segment[22].  |
| 1105 | ground water, unconfined. | Water in an aquifer that has a water table.  Synonymous with phreatic ground water[22].  |
| 1106 | grout. | A fluid mixture of cement and water (neat cement) of a consistency that can be forced through a pipe and placed where required.

Guano is only abundant in tropical regions and may be dry and powdery, or a foul, wet, sludge — as in the Niah Caves of Sarawak.  It is a vital food source for many troglobites.  Consisting mainly of phosphates and nitrate it is valued as a fertilizer or an ingredient of explosives and has commonly been mined.  Over 100,000 tons of bat guano have been extracted from Carlsbad Caverns, USA[9].  See also cave guano.  |

| 1118 | gypsum. | 1. White or colorless mineral or rock composed of the hydrated calcium sulfate, CaSO4.2H2O.  Gypsum rock is an evaporite precipitated from sea water and is therefore soluble in water and may contain dissolutional caves.  Mineral gypsum is formed in some caves by reactions between the host limestone and sulfates (including sulphuric acid) derived from oxidized sulfide minerals (see pyrite). Gypsum, also referred to as selenite, commonly occurs as transparent crystals, blades, needles or fibres in cave clay deposits.  A more spectacular form is as fibrous or curved crystals that may develop into cave flowers on cave walls and ceilings, as for example in parts of the Flint Mammoth Cave System, USA, or grow into large, hanging chandeliers, as in Lechuguilla Cave, New Mexico[9]. 2. A mineral composed of hydrous calcium sulfate[10], CaSO4·2H20.  |
| 1119 | gypsum cave. | Both vadose and phreatic caves can form in gypsum, which is very soluble in water, but they are uncommon because gypsum rock rarely survives total dissolution in the near-surface environments associated with explorable caves.  Gypsum caves certainly exist at depth within buried evaporate sequences.  In areas of wet climate gypsum caves are generally seen only if encountered by man-made excavations.  In contrast, gypsum caves are more common and more extensive in areas that have experienced a long period of dominantly arid climate.  The most spectacular gypsum caves are in the Podolie region of the Ukraine, where joint guided maze-cave systems are very extensive — Optimisticeskaja has around 180km of passsage[9].  |
| 1120 | gypsum flower. | See cave flower.  |
| 1121 | gypsum karst. | A karst landscape developed on, or perhaps above, gypsum or similar evaporite rock sequences.  Dissolution of gypsum by ground water in buried, interstratal, situations is common and the effects of such dissolution may be expressed at the land surface in the form of subsidence depressions.  There are extensive areas of gypsum karst in North America and the Ukraine but British examples are limited to rare caves, exposed by quarrying, and subsidence depressions above dissolved gypsum beds, such as those around Ripon, Yorkshire[9].  |

| 1124 | Halbhöhle. | (German.) See rock shelter.  |
| 1125 | Halbkugelkarst. | (German.) Tropical karst topography containing dome-shaped residual hills surrounding depressions, a kind of Kegelkarst.  Also called Kugelkarst[10].  |

| 1128 | half tube; half-tube. | 1. An inverted channel with semi-circular cross section seen in cave-passage ceilings, most clearly where the ceiling is an uneroded bedding surface.  The half tube originates as part of a phreatic tube guided by the bedding plane, and the lower half is subsequently removed by vadose enlargement.  The presence of half tubes provides important evidence of early phreatic-cave development[9].  2. Trace of a tube remaining in the roof or wall of a cave[10]. See also tube.  |
| 1129 | Hagen-Poiseuille equation. | The equation used to define the laminar flow of water in either fractures or tubes and is given as Q~=~-``{{w ^{3}b ITAL gamma} OVER {12µ}}{{dh} OVER {dL}} for laminar flow in fractures and Q~=~-``{{ ITAL pi r ^{4} ITAL gamma } OVER {8µ}}{{dh} OVER {dL}} for laminar flow in tubes which states that the average volumetric discharge of flow through either type of opening is directly proportional to the type, shape, and dimensions of a particular pore and the hydraulic gradient[5].  Note: Q=discharge, w=width of the fissure, b=open portion of the long dimension of the fissure, r=radius of the tube, γ and µ are the specific weight and dynamic viscosity of water respectively, dh/dL=gradient, and a minus sign is attached to the equations to indicate that flow occurs in the direction of deceasing hydraulic head.  |
| 1130 | halite. | The mineral form of sodium chloride (NaC1), or rock salt.  Halite occurs, sometimes to considerable thicknesses, in many buried-rock successions, from which it has been extracted both by mining and by redissolving it in water pumped from and back to the surface.  The existence of brine springs indicates that natural water movement occurs through buried halite sequences, presumably through voids that could be thought of as caves.  Although distinctive halite (or salt) karst features are known in some arid areas, a range of features analogous to those found on karstic rocks such as limestone are unlikely to form, and less likely to be preserved, due to halite’s relative weakness and very high solubility.  In Britain expressions of salt karstification are limited to relatively subdued surface features.  The “flashes” of the Cheshire area, are hollows, sometimes transformed into water-filled meres, formed by subsidence of overlying rocks and superficial deposits where salt has been dissolved from buried halite beds of Triassic age[9].  |

| 1132 | halocline. | A locally steep salinity gradient along the interface between fresh ground-water and saline ground-water, such as is found at the base of the freshwater lens common beneath many limestone islands in the tropics. Water mixing and microbial activity are important influences on dissolution along the halocline, as shown for instance in blue holes[9].  |
| 1133 | halomorphic soil. | Saline and alkali soils.  |
| 1134 | hanging blade. | A blade projecting down from the ceiling[10].  See also blade.  |

| 1145 | head, total. | The total head of a liquid at a given point is the sum of three components: (a) the elevation head, which is equal to the elevation of the point above a datum, (b) the pressure head, which is the height of a column of static water that can be supported by the static pressure at the point, and (c) the velocity head, which is the height to which the kinetic energy of the liquid is capable of lifting the liquid[22].  |
| 1146 | head water. | The upper reach of a stream[16].  |
| 1147 | heat of condensation. | The heat released in transforming a substance from its vapor to its liquid state[16].  |

| 1149 | heel-print karren. | See Trittkarren.  |
| 1150 | helictite. | 1. Generally small variety of stalactitic calcite growth that is twisted and contorted with no apparent regard for gravity.  Helictites form on cave walls, ceilings, and on stalactites.

A small depression (a few meters in diameter and several centimeters deep) in a level calcareous surface, enlarged by the solution effect of water collecting between slight undulations.  It is developed vertically at first by stagnant water; the steep sides thus evolved then induce the flow of water which flutes the slope and so eventually widens the basin.

| 1381 | keyhole passage; keyhole. | 1. This very descriptive name derives from the cross-sectional shape of a cave passage that consists of a phreatic tube with a vadose canyon cut in its floor.  It is the classic example of a two-phase cave passage that originated and began its development in the phreas and was then modified by vadose entrenchment.  As this sequence is the result of water table lowering by normal surface erosion, keyholes are common.  Some keyholes are so small that the lower slot is impassable and the caver has to squeeze along the upper tube; others are very large.  Spectacularly long is the 5km of keyhole forming the Fissures in Castleguard Cave, Canada.  A tube 6m in diameter tops an irregular tapering canyon 15m deep that must be traversed on sloping ledges at mid-level[9].  2. A small passage or opening in a cave; in cross section, rounded at the top, constricted in the middle, and rectangular or flared out below[10]. They appear as keyholes when viewed in cross section.  They are formed when underground streams flowing in a tubular passage begin downcutting to form a canyon passage[15].  See also canyon passage; passage; tubular passage; vertical shaft.  |

In most cases, an initial active lava conduit is formed when a flowing surface lava stream has a roof grow over it by accretion of chilled solidified material.  Insulated inside its conduit the lava can continue to flow and develop an airspace above it, which is preserved as an explorable cave when completely cooled.  Most lava caves are just very long tubes, though branching and multiple levels may occur as dictated by flow patterns and re-invasions of older tubes.  On Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii, the Kazumura Cave is 47km long and descends 888m, but its tubes, mostly 5m in diameter, lie less than 20m beneath the sloping surface of the lava[9].  2.

Tubes or tunnels are formed with such pseudokarst features as lava stalactites and also collapse structures and basins of closed drainage. Lava karst does not arise through solution of the rock by circulating water and thus is not a true karst[20].  Synonyms: (French.) pseudo-karst; (German.) (Vulkanischer Karst), Lava-Karst, Pseudokarst; (Greek.) pseudokarst; (Italian.) pseudocarsismo vulcanico; (Spanish.) volcanokarst (general), tubo volcanico (tube, tunnel), jameo (collapse structure), malpaís (topographic feature similar to lapiés); (Turkish.) lav karstı, a ldatıcı karst.

The purer limestones consist almost entirely of calcite; less pure rocks may be referred to as, for example, muddy limestone.  Some limestones are porous with diffuse permeability; these rarely become truly cavernous, though some fissure flow may occur.  Where ground-water flow in less porous rocks is restricted to bedding related fissures and secondary fractures it can, even when moving very slowly, corrode the almost entirely soluble rock and lead to true cave development[9].  |
| 1437 | limestone pavement. | 1. A level, or gently inclined, bare limestone surface scored and fretted by karren.  The stripping of soil or cover rocks to expose the bare rock pavement is a glacial process, and the development of the karren — both the dissolutional enlargement of the joints and also the dissolutional carving of runnels — is largely post-glacial.  Limestone pavements are characteristic features of glaciokarst and occur extensively in the north of England, in the Burren of County Clare in Ireland and on many high alpine limestones[9].  2. A bare plane surface of limestone, parallel to the bedding, commonly divided into blocks (clints, Flachkarren) by solutionally widened joints (grikes, Kluftkarren), and pitted by solution pans[10].  3.

Preparation and collection of the spores is very tedious, and the method lacks the convenience of using simple dyes[9].  2. Spores of Lycopodium clavatum, which can be used in natural or dyed color as a label in studying ground-water movement in karst areas[10].  |
| 1467 | lysimeter. | A device for measuring percolation and leaching losses from a column of soil under controlled conditions[22].  |

| 1490 | master cave. | Best defined as a low level trunk streamway cave with many tributaries.  The old concept of the master cave being formed at the water table should be disregarded.  The Leck Fell Master Cave, in the Yorkshire Dales, is 2km long, partly a vadose canyon, partly a drained phreatic tube and partly a submerged tube.  Part of it therefore lies below the water table while elsewhere its presence controls the water table.  The French equivalent, ‘collecteur’, is more descriptive of the master cave’s true role.  The depth to a currently active master cave is dictated by interactions between local topography, stratigraphical factors and geological structure.  In the low hill karst of England and Kentucky, active master caves lie at depths of around 100m, but in Monte Canin, Italy, and the Hautla Plateau, Mexico, they lie at depths of 1000m.  The collecteur of the Gouffre Berger, France, is met just 250m down but can be followed to a depth of over 1000m, down the dipping limestone beds, thus emphasizing the local dominance of stratigraphical over topographical factors[9].  |

| 1495 | maze cave. | A cave with an essentially horizontal network of interconnecting and mainly contemporaneous passage loops.  Three broad types of maze cave have been described — anastomotic, network and spongework — and these may be subdivided on the basis of how they developed by slow-moving water, restricted to a confined, artesian aquifer, or by water that is ponded due to backflooding.  A mechanism of potentially great importance, particularly in the context of the inception of network maze caves, is multiple, diffuse input from adjacent, permeable but non-cavernous rocks.  Spectacular joint-guided maze caves such as Knock Fell Caverns and the Devis Hole Mine Caverns occur in the thin Yoredale limestones of the northern Pennines, but the most extensive mazes are in the Black Hills of Dakota, USA (including Jewel Cave) and in the Ukrainian gypsum karst (including Optimisticeskaja)[9].

| 1498 | mean value. | The statistical average or measure of central tendency[16].  |
| 1499 | meander. | 1. Overdeveloped and self-exaggerated bend is a stream course either on the surface or underground, caused by more erosion on the outside than on the inside of a bend due to natural wash of the flow.  Undergound meanders commonly originate within bedding plane guided elements of the phreas, where a single dominant tube has gathered drainage from the surrounding area.  Following uplift and the onset of vadose conditions any stream that utilizes the meandering tube incises rapidly and the imposed meander course is entrenched into the underlying rocks. Such incision or entrenchment produces characteristic tall, narrow, twisting vadose canyons, to such an extent that the French describe them as ‘meandres’.  Canyons may meander more at their lower levels, due to enlargement during incision[9].  2. A loop-like bend in a river due to lateral erosion activities[16].  3.

Phreatic caves may include loops deep below the water table, particularly in dipping limestone with widely spaced bedding-related fissures. Higher fissure densities, sub-horizontal geological guidance, or greater karstic maturity encourage shallow phreatic development just below the water table.  Progressive abondonment of phreatic caves is usually in a downward sequence, as erosionally lowered valley floors intersect lower levels of the flooded system.  Active phreatic cave segments, left perched for geological reasons after a general water-table lowering, are relatively common.  Characteristics of phreatic caves are blind dissolution pockets on walls and ceilings, branching and looping of passages, and overall switchback gradients as phreatic flow may be uphill under pressure.  The most common passage, and overall switchback gradients as phreatic flow may be uphill under pressure.  The most common passage form is a tube, though cross-sectional shape reflects local geological factors.  A classic active phreatic cave is that behind the Fontaine de Vaucluse in France, while Hölloch, Switzerland, is a major system consisting mostly of relict phreatic passages[9].  2.

Pillars are common in phreatic caves, formed by complexly looping ground-water flow, but may also be left as small oxbow cores of vadose origin.  A spectacular group of pillars occurs in the ill-named Chamber of Columns in the Sof Omar cave, Ethiopia[9].  2. A column of rock remaining after solution of the surrounding rock.  3.

Formation of a passage by water under pressure in the form of conduits through permeable materials when the hydraulic head exceeds a certain critical value[10].  3. The mechanical washout of caves in gravels, soils, loess, etc., and shows evidence of associated collapse.  |

A large, flat floored depression in karst limestone, whose long axis is developed parallel to major structural trends and can reach tens of kilometers in length. Superficial deposits tend to accumulate on the floor.  Drainage may be by either surface watercourses (when the polje is said to be open) or swallow holes (a ‘closed’ polje.) Their development is encouraged by any impedance in the karst drainage[19].  2. Polje or karst polje signifies the flat-bottomed lands of closed basins which may extend over large areas, as much as 1,000 km2.  The flat floor of the polje may consist of bare limestone, of a nonsoluble formation (and so with rolling topography), or of soil.  The polje will show complex hydrogeological characteristics such as exsurgences, swallow holes, estavelles, and lost rivers.  In colloquial use, the term polje is applied to flat-bottomed lands which are overgrown or are under cultivation[20]. 3. Large flat-floored closed karst depression, with sharp slope breaks between the commonly alluviated floor and the marginal limestone.  Streams or springs drain into poljes and outflow is underground through ponors.  Commonly the ponors cannot transmit flood flows, so many poljes turn into wet-season lakes.  The form of some poljes is related to the geological structure, but others are purely the projects of lateral dissolution and planation.  The Dinaric Karst has many poljes; the Livansko polje is around 60km long and 7km wide.  The word is Slovene (common also to other Slav languages) for a field, reflecting the agricultural value of the alluvial polje floor soils[9]. Synonym: interior valley; (French.) polje; (German.) Polje; (Greek.) polye; (Italian.) polje; (Russian.) polje; (Spanish.) polje; (Turkish.) gölova, polye; (Yugoslavian.) polje.  See also karst polje.  |

The small karren forms disappear, grooves and grikes are widened and deepened.  One or two centuries after being laid bare, the earlier rounded edge is only just recognizable so round karren and their remains provide evidence of an earlier soil covering[3].  2.

| 2042 | sandstone caves. | Most natural sandstone caves are surface river-cut notches at the foot of rock cliffs, or left part way up the cliff due to later downcutting.  This origin accounts for most of the caves once inhabited by the Pueblo Indians in the sandstone cliffs of the western USA. True caves do occur in sandstone and some of these appear to be at least partially of dissolutional origin.  Their existence probably reflects matrix leaching by ground water moving through zones of especially high primary porosity and permeability.  Though sandstones with a calcite matrix cement are more prone to such development, even siliceous cement, which has a very low solubility in water, may be removed during a sufficiently long time span.  The sandstone caves of the Sarisarinama Plateau, Venezuela may be a special case of this type of development.  These include shafts 300m in diameter and 200m deep, and passages up to 500m long.  They were probably cut in the quartz sandstone by underground streams, after early leaching of the cement by hydrothermal solutions, and the shafts have been modified by later collapse[9].  |

| 2055 | scallop. | 1. A spoon-shaped hollow carved in a cave wall, floor or ceiling due to erosion by eddies in flowing water.  Scallops are commonly closely packed, leaving sharp ridges at the intersects. They range from 10mm to 1m in length and as a general rule the smaller they are then the faster flowing was the water that carved them.  The scallops are generally asymmetrical, with their upstream end steeper than the downstream end — a useful indicator of paleo-flow direction in abandoned passages[9].  2. Oval hollow having an asymmetric cross section along its main axis. Scallops form patterns on the walls of caves and in streambeds and may be used to determine direction of flow of turbulent water, since they are steeper on the upstream side.  Commonly called flutes in America[10].  Synonyms: (French.) cannelure, vague d’érosion; (German.) in Fließrichtung des Waßers ausgezogener Kolk; (Greek.) kílon o-oïthés; (Spanish.) huella de corriente; (Turkish.) degirmi, tarak.

| 2063 | sea cave. | 1. A cave cut in any rock type where a geological weakness is exploited by the highly selective erosion power of wave action.  Fingal’s Cave, cut in the basalt of Staffa, Scotland, is a famous example.  True sea caves should not be confused with dissolutional caves that pre-dated the wave action but were then intersected and revealed as a cliff line was eroded back such as caves in the Chalk at Beachy Head in south-east England.  In some young tropical islands, dissolutional voids have formed below sea-level in the mixing zone between fresh and saline ground water.  Some have subsequently been tectonically uplifted into a shoreline position, to give the misleading impression of having developed due to waver action.  Caves of this type on the coast of Tongatapu, Tonga, have pools that connect with active dissolutional cavities below sea-level that might be related to the mixing zone[9].  2. A cave or cleft in a sea cliff or coastal karst outcrop eroded by waves or currents or dissolved by circulating ground water[20]. Synonyms: (French.) grotte marine; (German.)

The sinking water may filter through a choke that excludes cavers, or may flow into an open horizontal cave or vertical shaft, and while active all of these may be termed sinkholes.  The flow of water may be very small, but in full flood many sinkholes swallow flows of tens of cubic meters per second.  The character of sink water (or swallet water, as it is commonly termed by hydrologists), flowing directly and rapidly into an open cave, distinguishes it from percolation water[9].  2.

| 2129 | siphon. | 1. Synonym for a sump, or a section of flooded cave passage, in common parlance.  True siphons, where water flows first up and then down are rare in caves, as the fractures in limestone tend to disrupt the required hydraulics.  They are, however, the origin of such intermittent springs as the Fontestorbes spring in France, and the Ebbing and Flowing Well at Giggleswick Yorkshire.  Both flow in regular pulses when the siphon is full and working, only to cease when the siphon input is broken by air, as the upstream reservoir level drops.  Their operation depends on critical flows and both operate only in favorable weather conditions[9].  2.  Gallery in form of an inverted ‘U’ with water moving only under pressure when the siphon has completely filled up; the water head at the input end being higher than at the drainage point[20].  3.

When the cavity is full, the siphon is complete and causes a pulse of water to issue from the spring.  This diminishes or empties the water supply in the cavity and no further water is discharged from the spring until the system is reactivated.  The discharge is said to be a reciprocating spring when a reduced level of flow is maintained between pulses[19].  2. A spring flowing at irregular intervals[16].

| 2257 | stalactite. | 1. Speleothem, generally of calcite, formed by dripping water and hanging from a cave roof.  Stalactites embrace an enormous variety of sizes and shapes.  They form where percolation water seeps from a cave ceiling and becomes saturated with respect to calcite due to loss of carbon dioxide into the cave air.  Calcite is precipitated round the rim of the water droplet and continued deposition creates a hollow tubular straw stalactite (soda straw).  Additional deposition of calcite on the outside of the initial cylinder creates an ordinary tapering stalactite. Almost infinite variation in shape may be influenced by changes in water flow, cave air chemistry, evaporation, temperature or dissolved impurities, and by crystal growth blocking flow paths.   They are the most common speleothem.  Though the single 7m long stalactite in Ireland’s Poll an Ionain is not the world’s longest, it is uniquely spectacular against the dark chamber walls[9].  2. Conical deposit of calcite or aragonite often with a hollow center hanging from the roof of a cave or cavern formed by precipitation of carbonate due to escape of CO2 from hanging water beads and to evaporation of part of the water[20].  3. A cylindrical or conical deposit of minerals, generally calcite, formed by dripping water, hanging from the roof of a cave, generally having a hollow tube at its center.  From Greek word meaning exude drops[10]. Synonyms: (French.) stalactite; (German.) Tropfstein, Stalaktit; (Greek.) stalaktitis; (Italian.) stalattite; (Russian.) stalaktit; (Spanish.) estalactita; (Turkish.) sarkıt (Yugoslavian.) mosur, viseci kapnik, stalaktit.  |
| 2258 | stalagmite. | 1. Speleothem, normally of calcite, formed by upward growth from a cave floor, and therefore the complement of a stalactite.  Stalagmites form when dripwater that is still saturated falls from a cave roof or stalactite and, when or after it lands, loses more carbon dioxide to the cave air, causing precipitation of calcite.  They vary in size and shape, from tall thin towers to wide domes that grade into flowstone, the main controls being drip rate and height, and saturation levels of the water.  The stalagmites of Aven Armand, France, are of the multiple splash-cup variety while being notably slender and up to 30m tall.  Spectacularly massive stalagmites occur in the Carlsbad and Cottonwood Caves of New Mexico[9].  2. Columnar or partly irregular deposit of calcite or aragonite on the floor of a cave or cavern formed by the precipitation of carbonates due to escape of CO2 from water dripping from the roof[20].  3.

| 2279 | storage coefficient. | 1. The volume of water an aquifer releases from or takes into storage per unit surface area of the aquifer per unit change in head[22].  In a confined aquifer, the water is derived from storage with decline in head resulting from an expansion of the water and compression of the aquifer.  Similarly, water added to storage with a rise in head is accommodated partly by compression of the water and partly by expansion of the aquifer.  In an unconfined aquifer, the amount of water so released or accepted is generally negligible compared to the amount involved in gravity drainage or filling of pores, hence, in an unconfined aquifer, the storage coefficient is virtually equal to the specific yield.  2. The volume of water an aquifer releases from or takes into storage per unit surface area of the aquifer per unit change in head (virtually equal to the specific yield in an unconfined aquifer.) 3.

| 2302 | stress. | The force acting across a given surface element divided by the area of the element.  |
| 2303 | stress, applied. | The downward stress imposed at an aquifer boundary.  It differs from effective stress in that it defines only the external stress tending to compact a deposit rather than the grain- to-grain stress at any depth within a compacting deposit[21].  |
| 2304 | stress, effective. | Stress (pressure) that is borne by and transmitted through the grain-to-grain contacts of a deposit, and thus affects its porosity or void ratio and other physical properties.  In one-dimensional compression, effective stress is the average grain-to-grain load per unit area in a plane normal to the applied stress.  At any given depth, the effective stress is the weight (per unit area) of sediments and moisture above the water table, plus the submerged weight (per unit area) of sediments between the water table and the specified depth, plus or minus the seepage stress (hydrodynamic drag) produced by downward or upward components, respectively, of water movement through the saturated sediments above the specified depth.  Thus, effective stress may be regarded as the algebraic sum of the two body stresses, gravitational stress, and seepage stress.  Effective stress mal also be regarded as the difference between geostatic and neutral stress[21].  |
| 2305 | stress, geostatic. | The total load per unit area of sediments and water above some plane of reference.  It is the sum of (1) the effective stress, and (2) the neutral stress[21].  |
| 2306 | stress, neutral. | Fluid pressure exerted equally in all directions at a point in a saturated deposit by the head of water.  Neutral pressure is transmitted to the base of the deposit through the pore water, and does not have a measurable influence on the void ratio or on any other mechanical property of the deposits[21].  |
| 2307 | stress, preconsolidation. | The maximum antecedent effective stress to which a deposit has been subjected, and which it can withstand without undergoing additional permanent deformation. Stress changes in the range less than the preconsolidation stress produce elastic deformations of small magnitude.  In fine-grained materials, stress increases beyond the preconsolidation stress produce much larger deformations that are principally inelastic (nonrecoverable)[21].  |
| 2308 | stress, seepage. | When water flows through a porous medium, force is transferred from the water to the medium by viscous friction.  The force transferred to the medium is equal to the loss of hydraulic head.  This force, called seepage force, is exerted in the direction of flow[21].  |
| 2309 | stress, shear. | Stress directed parallel (tangential) to the surface element across which it acts.  |

| 2323 | sub-conduit. | Any void, whether of tectonic or dissolutional origin, that is smaller than the accepted defined size of a conduit.  Sub-conduits originate under inception conditions and enlarge during gestation, but many fail to achieve larger dimensions when drainage later becomes concentrated along preferred routes.  In most cases, however, they will continue to function as part of the micro-fissure, or percolation, system within the rock mass.  Sub-conduits are an essential part of a continuum of void sizes that extends between microscopic discontinuities and the largest tube passages[9].  |

| 2351 | sulfate. | A mineral compound characterized by the sulfate radical SO42–.  Anhydrous sulfates, such as barite, BaSO4, have divalent cations linked to the sulfate radical; hydrous and basic sulfates, such as gypsum, CaSO4.2H2O, contain water molecules[1].  |
| 2352 | sulfate minerals. | Minerals containing the SO42– radical, formed by precipitation from water.  The most common are the anhydrous and hydrated calcium sulfates, anhydrite (CaSO4) and gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O).  Sulfates are deposited as a generally minor component of most carbonate successions, but due to their high solubility they may not survive subsequent dissolution by ground water.  Even if they survive subsequent dissolution by ground water.  Even if they survive at depth, they tend to dissolve as they are raised nearer to the surface following uplift and erosion of overburden.  Removal of sulfates by dissolution may contribute to the early establishment of secondary permeability in limestone sequences. Sulfate solutions have a limited corrosional effect upon calcium carbonate, but may also be oxidized to produce sulphuric acid, which is highly corrosive of limestone.  |
| 2353 | sulfate-reduction karst. | Karst topography developed in the subsurface where solution of bedrock is chiefly a result of sulfate reduction by petroleum hydrocarbons aided by bacterial processes that oxidize hydrocarbons to yield carbon dioxide.

| 2359 | sump. | 1. In caves a sump is a section of flooded passage.  This may be a perched sump, probably quite short, within a vadose cave and created by a local reverse passage gradient.  Alternatively it may be a major feature, where a cave passage descends below the regional water table into the phreas, as is common at the lower end of many cave systems.  Some short sumps can be dived without the use of breathing apparatus, but most are restricted to exploration by cave divers. Logistics are a barrier to endless sump penetrations, but some have now been explored for many kilometers in length, notable in Cocklebiddy Cave, Australia, the Nohoch Nah Chich and other great flooded systems in Mexico’s Yucatan, and behind Keld Head in Yorkshire[9].  2.

| 2474 | tower karst, towerkarst, turmkarst. | 1. A spectacular variety of karst landscape dominated by steep or vertical sided limestone towers each 30–300m high.  By far the most extensive and best developed tower karst is the Guangxi province of southern China.  Towers originate as residual cones and are then steepened by water table undercutting from surround alluviated plains. Tectonic uplift matched by karst erosion then increases tower heights, but if uplift exceeds surface lowering the towers are raised to hillside locations and the landscape is rejuvenated to form a new generation of dolines and cone karst.  Many towers are riddled with relict caves at high levels, and with active caves through their bases[9].  2. Karst topography characterized by isolated residual limestone hills displaying numerous shapes (e.g., cone shaped, steep-sided) separated by areas of alluvium or other detrital sand; towers are generally forest-covered hills, and many have flat tops.  They may form as isolated hills or in groups.  3.

| 2497 | travertine. | 1. Hard calcareous mineral deposited by flowing water, that is the same as the calcareous variety of sinter and comparable to the softer tufa.  The term is normally used only for deposits formed outside caves, where plants and algae cause the precipitation by extracting carbon dioxide from the water and give travertine its porous structure. Travertine forms most commonly on waterfalls that build up like gour dams.  Famous examples include those at Plitvice in Croatia, Dunn’s River Falls in Jamaica, and, largest of all, Band-I-Amir in Afghanistan[9].  2. Calcium carbonate, CaCO3, light in color and generally concretionary and compact, deposited from solution in ground and surface waters.  Extremely porous or cellular varieties are known as calcareous tufa, calcareous sinter, or spring deposit.  Compact banded varieties, capable of taking a polish, are called onyx marble or cave onyx[10].  3. Generally compact calcium carbonate rock formed by precipitation of soluble bicarbonates when equilibrium is lost due to changes in temperature and chemical characteristics.  Soft, porous variety is called calcareous tufa[20].  Synonyms: (French.) travertin; (German.)

| 2508 | Trittkarren. | (German.) These are best described as heel-print karren because they resemble the imprint of a heel.  They are nearly connected with subhorizontal, adjacent, flat plains and migrate upslope by cutting ‘steps’ through the process of retrogressive corrosion.  The semi-circular form is preserved by the ‘horseshoe falls effect’ which concentrates the main amount of water on the innermost part of the heel-print.  At the upper rim the water gain speed.  The thickness of the film of water is indirectly proportional to the speed of the flow.  A higher rate of flow results in a greater effectiveness of fresh precipitation added to the flow on the ground, but it also causes the diffusion of atmospheric CO2 and more extensive corrosion.  Most Trittkarren originate at the rim of a grike lying below and have moved upward to the surface through retrogressive corrosion.  At the base of steep slopes where snow collects, nearly funnel-shaped Trittkarren appear and are of subnival origin.  They are common in the Alps[3].  Synonym: heel-print karren.  |

| 2521 | tube, lava. | See lava cave.  |
| 2522 | tubular passage; tube; tube passage. | 1. Cave passage formed by approximately equal dissolution all round when full of flowing water within the phreas.  Relict tubes, abandoned as the water table was lowered, are common in old caves, and may be partially filled by sediment, breakdown or stalagmite, or entrenched to form keyhole passages.  Tube sizes range to over 15m in diameter, but the larger ones are rarely of uniform section.  Peak Cavern in Derbyshire is well known for its fine circular phreatic tubes.  Some of the trunk passages of Mammoth Cave, Kentucky, are spectacular tubes of elliptical section, formed by dissolution rates that were higher along the bedding than across[9].  2. These are nearly horizontal cave passages (tunnels) with round or elliptical cross sections and are either straight or winding.  At Mammoth Cave they vary in size up to 30 feet high and nearly 100 feet wide.  They are formed while completely filled with flowing water.  Whereas they are typically wider than high as a result of dissolution along horizontal cracks and bedding-plane partings, they may also form as high, narrow, straight fissures along major vertical or near vertical fractures[15].  See also canyon passage; keyhole passage; passage; vertical shaft.  |
| 2523 | tubular spring. | See spring, tubular.  |

| 2528 | turbulence. | An irregular motion of fluid particles in an inertia dominated flow regimen[16].  |
| 2529 | turbulent flow. | 1. Type of flow that begins to develop in a dissolutional sub-conduit as its diameter increases to the point where differences between flow velocity at the bounding wall (slowed due to friction and adhesion) and the maximum velocity in the tube’s center are sufficient to cause development of eddies within the flowing water[9].  2. The flow condition in which inertial forces predominate over viscous forces and in which head loss is not linearly related to velocity[22].  It is typical of flow in surface-water bodies and subsurface conduits in karst terranes provided that the conduits have a minimum diameter of approximately 2–5mm although some research has suggested that 5–15 mm may be more appropriate.  See also laminar flow; Reynolds Number; turbulent threshold.  |
| 2530 | turbulent threshold. | The limiting value of sub-conduit size, below which water flow is essentially laminar and above which water flow includes a significant turbulent component.  Sub-conduit diameters between 5mm and 15mm have been suggested as the minimum for turbulent flow, but the value depends upon a variety of factors, including the flow velocity; at low flow velocities laminar flow conditions may persist in tubes up to 500mm in diameter[9].  See also laminar flow; Reynolds Number; turbulent flow.  |
| 2531 | turlough. | (Irish.)  1. A karst depression that may be dry or flooded according to season or prevailing weather conditions; derived from the Irish term for ‘dry lake’.  Oscillations in the general ground-water level, including variations in response to local or more distant tidal effects are the probable mechanism for water level changes in the true turloughs.  Effects that appear similar can be produced by high surface runoff into a closed depression with only restricted capacity for the drainage to sink underground[9].  2. A depression in limestone or in glacial drift over limestone that is liable to flood either from excess surface runoff or from rising ground water.  From the Irish words tuar loch, meaning dry lake[10].  |

| 2547 | underfit stream. | A small stream that flows along a cave passage that was enlarged to its current size by an earlier, larger stream.  Commonly underfit streams are found flowing under vadose conditions along the floors of drained phreatic tubes, long abandoned by the phreatic flow that enlarged them.  Underfit streams may also occur if the major flow in a vadose streamway is captured to lower levels by the opening of a new shaft.  The main flow no longer uses the downstream passages, leaving any tributaries to amalgamate as an underfit stream[9].  |
| 2548 | underflow. | Deep phreatic flow within an aquifer, along flow lines that are largely unrelated to the more obvious flow at higher levels.  Underflow drainage may be slower than that in shallower systems, and may travel towards more distant and/or unrelated springs[9].  |

| 2566 | urkarst. | See buried karst.  |
| 2567 | uvala. | 1. A multi-coned closed depression; now little-used term of Croat, Serb or Bulgarian origin. The term was introduced to describe features assumed to be the second step in a 3-stage process of polje development, in which dolines were supposed to coalesce into uvalas.  This mechanism is no longer accepted and the term uvala has fallen into disuse[9].  2. Large closed depression formed by the coalescence of several dolines which have enlarged towards each other. Typically, the floor is irregular, being a combination of doline floors and degraded slopes of the individual hollows[19].  3.

| 2569 | vadose cave. | 1. A cave that underwent most of its development above the water table.  Within the vadose zone, drainage is free-flowing under gravity, and cave passages therefore have air above any water surface.  The gravitational control of vadose flow means that all vadose cave passages drain downslope, they exist in the upper part of a karst aquifer, and they ultimately drain into the phreatic zone or out to the surface.  Active stream caves, explorable by non-diving cavers, are by definition vadose (though they generally have phreatic origins).  Characteristics of vadose caves are uneroded ceilings (except for immature phreatic features pre-dating the vadose conditions) and continuous downhill gradients (unless interrupted by short perched sumps).  The main passage forms are canyons, with meanders and potholes, broken by sub-cylindrical, spray- corroded shafts that may demonstrate waterfall retreat.  Some of the caves of Monte Canin, Italy, are spectacularly long and deep vadose systems[9].  2. Older, higher cave passages found in the vadose zone; usually vadose caves have been abandoned by the ground water except in times of extreme aquifer recharge.  Passages are usually appear as canyons and keyholes.  |

| 2573 | vadose water. | 1. That part of the underground water in a karst limestone which circulates freely under gravity above the level of saturation - the vadose zone.  Caves formed by flowing water are said to be vadose caves[19].  2. Water in the zone of aeration; water above the zone of saturation[10].  |
| 2574 | vadose zone. | 1. The zone between the land surface and the water table[22].  2. The zone between the land surface and the deepest water table which includes the capillary fringe.  Generally, water in this zone is under less than atmospheric pressure, and some of the voids may contain air or other gases at atmospheric pressure.  Beneath flooded areas or in perched water bodies the water pressure locally may be greater than atmospheric[22].  When discussing a karst setting, it is preferable to use the term, vadose zone, so as to avoid confusion regarding chemical saturation. Synonym: unsaturated zone.  See also zone of aeration.  |

| 2593 | vertical shaft. | These are formed by underground water dripping of flowing straight downward through the limestone along vertical cracks.  Uniformly distributed dissolution of the rock results in a silo- or well-shaped passage so that most of them appear roughly circular in cross section when viewed straight up and down.  They form above active tubular passages although they may intersect a limited number of passages along their length.  At Mammoth Cave, they range in size from 30 feet across to 200 feet from top to bottom[15].  Synonym: dome-pit.

| 2644 | water table. | 1. The top surface of a body of slowly moving ground water that fills the pore spaces within a rock mass.  Above it lies the freely draining vadose zone, and below it lies the permanently saturated phreas.  In uniform aquifers, such as sandstone, the water table is a smoothly contoured surface intersecting the ground at rivers and lakes, but in limestone it is more complex.  Individual cave conduits may be above or below the water table, and therefore either vadose or phreatic, and the water table cannot normally be related to them.  The water table concept does, however, apply to the diffuse drainage of percolation water in the micro- fissure network of limestone, but its detailed structure may be complicated by the presence of conduits.  The water-table slope (hydraulic gradient) is low in limestone due to the high permeability, and the level is controlled by outlet springs or local geological features.  High flows create steeper hydraulic gradients and hence rises in the water level away from the spring. In France’s Grotte de la Luire, the water level in the cave (and therefore the local water table) fluctuates by 450m[9].  2. The upper surface of a zone of saturation except where that surface is formed by a confining unit[22].  3. The upper surface of the zone of saturation on which the water pressure in the porous medium equals atmospheric pressure[22].  4. The upper boundary of an unconfined zone of saturation, along which the hydrostatic pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure[10].  See also potentiometric surface.  |
| 2645 | water-table aquifer. | See unconfined aquifer.  |
| 2646 | water-table cave. | In theory the water table offers the prime environment for cave development as it provides the shortest route through the phreas and is potentially more active chemically due to the presence of the air/water interface.  However, geological factors determine the details of cave inception and enlargement, and passages most commonly form just below the water table as a shallow phreatic variety of cave development.  Development of this type is believed to be responsible for the ‘levels’ of cave passage found in some areas, as in the flint Mammoth Cave System, Kentucky.  True water-table caves are rare except on a limited scale as extensions to cliff foot notches margined to tropical swamps.  Also under these conditions, the water table may adjust down to the level of a mature phreatic cave and then modify the passage with horizontal dissolution notches — as is common in the caves of Mulu and Niah, Sarawak[9].  |

| 2649 | water tracing. | Underground drainage links through unexplored caves confirmed by labeling input water and identifying it at points downstream.  The common labeling techniques involve the use of fluorescent dyes (fluorescein, rhodamine, leucophor, pyranine etc.), lycopodium spores, or chemicals such as common salt.  Detection of dye downstream may be purely visual, but if the dye is used at a subvisible (environmentally acceptable) dilution, suitable detectors must be placed in all potential risings and collected for subsequent fluorometric examination (although water samples are more desirable and beneficial).  Lycopodium spores are usually collected in fine nets, along with other stream-borne sediment, and must then be identified under the microscope.  If chemical tracers are used, regular water samples must be collected for subsequent analysis, or the resurgent waters must be monitored with suitable electronic detectors and recorders.  Flowpaths can also be confirmed by transmission of artificial or natural flood pulses, which provide additional data on the nature of conduits, as a pulse is transmitted instantaneously through flooded passages. The longest successful water trace was from Beysehir Golu to the Manavgat springs, in Turkey, over a distance of 130km; 390kg of fluorescein was used and the dye reappeared after 366 days[9].  |
