PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION

Release of the first edition of this lexicon was well received and resulted in
two printings. The first edition is again in short supply, but rather than
going through a third printing, an updated edition was deemed appropriate.
Since the release of the first edition, additional definitions related to
biospeleology, courtesy of Dr. William R. Elliott of the Natural History
Division of the Missouri Department of Conservation, have been added.
Additional definitions obtained from the Australian Speleological Federation
also have been added.

Researchers and the general public alike will find these additions useful as
they work their way through the published literature. For this second edition,
the literature search is current to 2002. To be sure, this updated lexicon is
far from complete and will more than likely be updated in a few years.

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION

The National Center for Environmental Assessment-Washington Office (NCEA-W) has
prepared this document for the benefit of the regional offices and public in
general due to the need to understand the terminology common to the field of
karst. It is a glossary of most terms that have some relationship to the field
of environmental karst as well as specific karst terms. It includes many
foreign terms because much of the karst research is conducted in foreign
countries and published using local terminology. In many instances, common
environmental terms are defined in such a way as to specifically reference
karstic phenomena.

The purpose of this document is to serve as a technical guide to regional
offices and the public in general who must read the karst literature or who
must hold discussions with karst researchers. It is intended that this document
remove much of the confusion surrounding many of the karst terms.

The literature search supporting this lexicon is current to 1998.

INTRODUCTION

Several attempts to classify karst terminology in an organized manner have been
attempted in the past. The last few glossaries of karst terminology were
organized in the late 1960s and published in the early 1970s. Since that time,
many new terms related to karst in general have come into use throughout the
world while other older karst terms are seldom used nowadays. In the mid 1990s
the British Cave Research Association (BCRA) published and updated a dictionary
that covers the general area of karst and caves, but did not focus on
environmental issues.

Many of the more recent karst terms are related to the upsurge in
environmentalism and the recognition among karst cognoscenti that karst
terranes are much more sensitive to man-induced effects on the environment than
are other types of landscapes. In an attempt to be as broad as possible in this
glossary, terms related to general hydrology and hydrogeology, common karst
rock and mineral types, and many of the descriptive terms used in speleology
even where they relate to specific localities, have been included. No attempt
was made to exclude foreign karst terms although many are no doubt, missing.
This has led to a much larger manuscript than was originally intended when this
project was initiated, but it has provided for a more comprehensive document.

Because many non-karst professionals, whether working on basic research or on
environmental problems, need to have a general working knowledge of karst
terminology, this glossary was developed to provide an up-to-date reference for
more modern definitions of karst terms both currently in usage and now defunct.
As with any undertaking of this sort, numerous omissions will be shown to be
evident. In other instances, disagreements regarding definitions will arise. In
the event that readers of this glossary find various omissions or incorrect
definitions, it would be greatly appreciated if the necessary corrections be
forwarded to the author so that the glossary may be updated in the future.

As a final note, it should be pointed out that a list of references for the
definitions are included at the back of this glossary and citations are
provided when appropriate. In many instances, duplication of definitions from
previous glossaries were employed to avoid changing the original definitions.
However, efforts were not always attempted to cite the exact source for each
definition as this would have greatly lengthened this already excessively long
manuscript; secondary citations have been provided. Exact citations would also
have resulted in confusion where several definitions were utilized in the
writing of a single clear definition for any particular term. In no instance
was it intended that the work of others be appropriated, only that this
glossary be as comprehensive and clear as possible while avoiding excessive
clutter. Also, where definitions were deemed to be incorrect or poorly worded,
alternatives have been written.
