| 1 | abîme | (French)  1. An abyss.  2. A wide, deep shaft, in limestone, the walls of which are vertical or overhanging [10]. |
| 2 | ablation | The wearing away of ice or snow through the process of evaporation [16]. |
| 3 | abney level | Type of clinometer with a bubble tube used in cave survey to determine vertical angles [25]. |
| 4 | abris sous roche | (French) See rock shelter. |
| 5 | abseil | 1.  (n.) A controlled descent of a rope using friction obtained by either wrapping the rope around the body in a particular way or passing the rope through a carabiner or passing the rope through a descender [25].  2. (v.) To do an abseil [25].  Synonym: rappel.  |
| 6 | absorption | The process by which substances in gaseous, liquid or solid form dissolve or mix with other substances [22]. |
| 7 | abyss | Extremely great depth [16]. |
| 8 | accelerated corrosion | A localized concentration of solution intensity, produced by factors favoring greater aggressivity of the water in certain parts of the karstland creating differential solution rates and thereby a marked unevenness in the overall erosion of the karstland [19]. See also corrosion; alluvial corrosion.  |
| 471 | Chézy equation | An equation used to compute the velocity of uniform flow in an open channel: mean velocity of flow equals the Chézy coefficient times the square root of the product of hydraulic radius times the slope of the channel [1].  See also Froude number; Manning equation; Reynolds number. |
| 525 | coefficient of volume compressibility | The compression of a clay (aquitard) per unit thickness, due to a unit increase of effective stress, in the load range exceeding preconsolidation stress. It is expressed by the equation $m_v = a_v / (1 + e_0)$ in which $e_0$ is the initial void ratio. Units are usually cm<sup>2</sup>/kg [21]. See also coefficient of compressibility. |
| 573 | consolidation | 1. The binding of grains by cementing material to solid matrix [16].  2. The gradual reduction in the water content (void ratio) of a saturated soil, as a result of an increase in the pressure acting on it, because of the addition of overlying sediments or the application of an external load.  A laboratory test commonly known as a one-dimensional consolidation test (odometric test), is performed on soil samples to evaluate consolidation.  From such a test, the coefficient of consolidation, $c_v$ usually expressed in cm<sup>2</sup>/sec, is calculated as the ratio $c_v = K l / m_v \gamma_w$ where $K$ is the hydraulic conductivity, $m_v$ is the coefficient of volume compressibility, and $\gamma_w$ is the unit weight of water. The theory of consolidation leads to a relation between degree of consolidation and time: $U\% = c_v t / H^2$ In this expression U is the degree of consolidation or the percentage of total consolidation occurring in some time $t$ and $H$ is half of the sample’s thickness when the odometric test is performed [21]. |
| 656 | Darcy’s law | An empirical law given as $Q = -KA\, dh/dL$ which states that the average volumetric discharge of flow through a porous medium is directly proportional to the hydraulic gradient assuming that the flow is laminar and inertia can be neglected.  Note: $Q$=discharge, $K$=hydraulic conductivity, $A$=cross-sectional area, $dh/dL$=gradient, and a minus sign is attached as a convention to indicate that flow occurs in the direction of decreasing head [5]. |
| 658 | Darcy-Weisbach equation | An empirical equation given as $Q = -A \sqrt{\frac{8Rg}{f} \frac{dh}{dL}}$ which states that in contrast to laminar flow, the average volumetric discharge of flow is directly proportional to the square root of the driving force and that the friction loss is equal to the hydraulic head [5].  Note: $Q$=discharge, $A$=cross-sectional area, $R$=hydraulic radius of the conduit, $g$=gravitational acceleration, $f$=some friction factor, $dh/dL$=gradient, and I have attached a negative sign to indicate that ground-water flow occurs in the direction of decreasing head.  In most instances, a negative sign is not included because it is not possible to take the square root of a negative number. |
| 1129 | Hagen-Poiseuille equation | The equation used to define the laminar flow of water in either fractures or tubes and is given as $Q = -\frac{w^3 b \gamma}{12µ} \frac{dh}{dL}$ for laminar flow in fractures and $Q = -\frac{\pi r^4 \gamma}{8µ} \frac{dh}{dL}$ for laminar flow in tubes which states that the average volumetric discharge of flow through either type of opening is directly proportional to the type, shape, and dimensions of a particular pore and the hydraulic gradient [5].  Note: $Q$=discharge, $w$=width of the fissure, $b$=open portion of the long dimension of the fissure, $r$=radius of the tube, $γ$ and $µ$ are the specific weight and dynamic viscosity of water respectively, $dh/dL$=gradient, and a minus sign is attached to the equations to indicate that flow occurs in the direction of deceasing hydraulic head. |
| 1477 | Manning equation | An equation used to compute the velocity of uniform flow in open channel: $V=(1.00/n) R^{2/3} S^{1/2}$ (SI units), where $V$ is the mean velocity of flow, $R$ is the hydraulic radius, $S$ is the slope of the channel or sine of the slope angle, and $n$ is the Manning roughness coefficient [1].
