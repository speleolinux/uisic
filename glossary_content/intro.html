This is a works-in-progress Stage 1 of introducing the English version of the UIS Cave and Karst Glossary. 
At this stage of the project it is effectively just a direct conversion of Malcolm Field's 2002 Second Edition 
<a href="https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/risk/recordisplay.cfm?deid=54964">PDF</a> US-EPA publication 
(<cite>A Lexicon of Cave and Karst Terminology with Special Reference to Environmental Karst Hydrology</cite>), 
but with our Term Numbers added. With Malcolm's assistance we are using it as the starting point for a 
major UIS Glossary resource. It replaces our initial Draft 1 of 2022-11-30 and fixes most of the conversion problems in that draft.
</p>

<p>Later stages will include internal cross-referencing, term-linking between the existing 
<a href="http://uisic.uis-speleo.org/lexintro.html">UIS Multi-lingual Dictionary</a> and 
the Glossary to provide definitions for the Dictionary's concepts, integration of 
his non-English terms and synonyms with the Multi-lingual Dictionary, and the proper presentation of scientific equations. 
We will of course be inviting improvements to Malcolm's terms, additional terms, the incorporation of other specialist 
glossaries, and expansion into glossaries in other languages. The Glossary will also be integrated into the 
<a href="http://uisic.uis-speleo.org/exchange/karstlink/index-en.html">UIS <cite>KarstLink</cite> Ontology</a> for Linked Data.
</p>

<p>
Each term can be directly accessed or linked to by appending for example, #33, to the address of this page 
in order to go directly to Term Number 33. These Term Numbers are now stable and are independent 
from the Concept Numbers used in the Multi-lingual Dictionary. Similarly, details of references can be accessed: e.g. for 
Reference [10], append #ref10 to the page address and press &lt;Enter&gt;. This web page can also be downloaded for offline use 
(675KB). Printing or producing a PDF of this web page will run to about 207 A4 pages, with intelligent page breaks.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://uisic.uis-speleo.org/lexgloss.html#conversion">conversion</a> from 
the 2700-term PDF <cite>Lexicon</cite> to this web page has involved 
quite a lot of detailed work, and there could be things we missed, so if you notice anything that needs fixing, please do 
<a href="mailto:Peter Matthews - Glossary <matthews&#000000064;melbpc.org.au>"> email us</a> with the details. 
Any temporary editorial comments added by the Glossary Project will show as [GP: .... ].
