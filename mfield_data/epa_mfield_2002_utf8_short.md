| ----------- | ---- | ----------- |
| 1 | abîme | (French.)  1. An abyss.  2. A wide, deep shaft, in limestone, the walls of which are vertical or overhanging[10].  |
| 2 | ablation. | The wearing away of ice or snow through the process of evaporation[16].  |
| 3 | abney level. | Type of clinometer with a bubble tube used in cave survey to determine vertical angles[25].  |
| 4 | abris sous roche. | (French.)  See rock shelter.  |
| 5 | abseil. | 1.  (n.) A controlled descent of a rope using friction obtained by either wrapping the rope around the body in a particular way or passing the rope through a carabiner or passing the rope through a descender[25].  2. (v.) To do an abseil[25].  Synonym: rappel.  |
| 6 | absorption. | The process by which substances in gaseous, liquid or solid form dissolve or mix with other substances[22].  |
| 7 | abyss. | Extremely great depth[16].  |
| 8 | accelerated corrosion. | A localized concentration of solution intensity, produced by factors favoring greater aggressivity of the water in certain parts of the karstland creating differential solution rates and thereby a marked unevenness in the overall erosion of the karstland[19]. See also corrosion; alluvial corrosion.  |
| 9 | accessory mineral. | Mineral constituents of a rock occurring in very small amounts[16].  |
| 10 | accidental. | An animal accidentally living in a cave[25].  |
| 11 | acclivity. | Ascending a slope[16].  |
| 12 | accretion. | Land addition by sediment deposition of a stream[16].  |
| 13 | accumulation. | Building of new land by addition of sedimentary deposits[16].  |
| 14 | acetylene. | An inflammable hydrocarbon gas, C₂H₂, produced by water reacting with calcium carbide. When burned, yields carbon dioxide as well as light[25].  |
| 15 | acid. | Any chemical compound containing hydrogen capable of being replaced by positive elements or radicals to form salts. In terms of dissociation theory, it is a compound which, on dissociation in solution, yields excess hydrogen ions. Acids lower the pH. Examples of acids or acidic substances are hydrochloric acid, tannic acid, and sodium acid pyrophosphate[6].  |
| 16 | acidity. | The property of water having a pH below 4.5 that is caused by the presence of mineral acids. Usually expressed in equivalent amounts of calcium carbonate[16]. See also alkalinity; pH.  |
| 17 | acid mine drainage. | Acid waters originating from surface or underground mine workings[16].  |
| 18 | acoustic log. | Geophysical borehole log measuring the speed of sound in rocks to determine porosity[16].  |
| 19 | acoustic resistance. | The product of wave velocity and rock density indicating the reflective power of a boundary between two strata[16].  |
| 20 | activated charcoal, activated carbon. | A granular material usually produced by the roasting of cellulose base substances, such as wood or coconut shells, in the absence of air. It has an extremely porous structure and is used in water conditioning as an adsorbent for organic matter and certain dissolved gases[6]. It is especially useful for adsorbing tracer dyes.  |
