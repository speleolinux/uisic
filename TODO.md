# TODO

This is a list of TODOs that Peter and Mike are attending to.
It is a quicker way to record stuff to do than the Issues list.    
The Unassigned section is for issues to be noted and later assigned to
someone.

## Unassigned

Inconsistent use of - or – for number range separator e.g.:

50–500mm deep    
1,000-3,000 mg/L    
3,000-10,000 mg/L    
10,000-35,000 mg/L

## Peter Matthews

Will be fixing the scientific equations.

## Mike Lake

### Chemical Formulas

Currently fixing chemical formulas.

UPTO here. 18 March 2023

481 cimolite: the final '12' should be a subscript.

### Numbering / Ordering Issues

At the end of entry "1688 paragenetic cave" we have ". parahopeite. A cave mineral 
Zn3(PO4)2·4H2O[11]." This should be a separate entry with ID 1689, jacking up all following ID entries by one.

### Version and Build Date 

Place a version date at the top and the build data at the bottom of the page.

### Continuous Integration

I have commented out the *auto* updating of the glossary at <https://speleolinux.github.io/uisic/>
until I work out how to stop Github pages from running when it's not required.

A manual update can be triggered by clicking the "Actions" tab at the top.
Then on the left hand side, under "All workflow" click "Publish Glossary".
Then on the right hand side in the blue header will be a drop down "Run workflow".
Drop down that and click the button "Run workflow"
