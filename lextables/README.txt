This directory contains test CSV files of the tables for the UIS Cavers Multi-lingual Dictionary.
They were extracted by Peter Matthews on 2022.10.19 and imported into here by Mike Lake.

NOTE: Most of these CSV files are encoded as Unicode UTF-8, so should only be opened or modified using a Unicode-aware editor, such as NotePad++, otherwise they will probably lose their proper encoding.
