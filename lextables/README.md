# README

This directory contains some of the CSV files from the tables in the UIS Cavers
Multi-lingual Dictionary. They were extracted by Peter Matthews on 2022.10.19
and imported into here by Mike Lake. Each CVS file is complete, it is not a
shortened version. 

Their current purpose here is to test how they display in Github and to be used
in testing a continuous integration process for maintaining the UIS Dictionary
and Glossary.

NOTE: Most of these CSV files are encoded as Unicode UTF-8, so should only be
opened or modified using a Unicode-aware editor, such as NotePad++, otherwise
they will probably lose their proper encoding.
