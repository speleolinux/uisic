# UISIC Test Repo

This is just a test repo for UISIC projects.

## This Projects Github Page(s)

The projects page(s) are at: <https://speleolinux.github.io/uisic/>    
There is a `gh-pages` branch for this.

### To Use a Single Page

Ensure the `gh-pages` branch contains the `index.html` page.

## To use a MkDocs Site

The docs directory contains pages suitable for a MkDocs site.
See the `mkdocs.yaml` file for this. If you wish to build that site 
as a CI job then copy the `mkdocs_ci.yml` to .github/workflows/ci.yml`
and push the change.
